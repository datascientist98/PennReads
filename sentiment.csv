Stop Walking on Eggshells: Taking Your Life Back When Someone You Care About Has Borderline Personality Disorder,,,,,,,,,,157224108X,,,,992/1037,5.0,903916800,"A SINGULAR, INDISPENSABLE, LIFE-SAVING CONTRIBUTION ON BPD","I don't know how Randi Kreger and Paul Mason did it, but they have made a singular contribution to the world with their web site and with the publication of this life-saving book. Please allow me to post this from the book for anyone looking for help in or out of a bad situation right now:Predictable Stages: People who love someone with BPD seem to go through similar stages. The longer the relationship has lasted, the longer each stage seems to take. Although these are listed in the general order in which people go through them, most people move back and forth among different stages.Confusion Stage. This generally occurs before a diagnosis of BPD is known. Non-BPs struggle to understand why borderlines sometimes behave in ways that seem to make no sense. They look for solutions that seem elusive, blame themselves, or resign themselves to living in chaos. Even after learning about BPD, it can take non-BPs weeks or months to really comprehend on an intellectual level how the BP is personally affected by this complex disorder. It can take even longer to absorb the information on an emotional level.Outer-Directed Stage. In this stage, non-borderlines turn their attention toward the person with the disorder, urging them to seek professional help, attemping to get them to change, and trying their best not to trigger problematic behavior. People at this stage usually learn all they can about BPD in an effort to understand and empathize with the person they care about. It can take nopn-BPs a long time to acknowledge feelings of anger and grief--especially when the BP is a parent or child. Anger is an extremely common reaction, even though most non-BPs understand on an intellectual level that BPD is not the borderline's fault. Yet because anger seems to be an inappropriate response to a situation that may be beyond the borderline's control, non-BPs often suppress their anger and instead experience depression, hopelessness, and guilt. The chief tasks for non-BPs in this stage include acknowledging and dealing with their own emotions, letting BPs take responsibility for their own actions, and giving up the fantasy that the BP will behave as the non-BP would like them to.Inner-Directed Stage. Eventually, non-BPs look inward and conduct an honest apparaisal of themselves. It takes two people to have a relationship, and the goal for non-BPs in this stage is to better understand their role in making the relationship what it now is. The objective here is not self-recrimination, but insight and self-discovery.Decision-Making Stage. Armed with knowledge and insight, non-BPs struggle to make decisions about the relationship. This stage can often take months or years. Non-BPs in this stage need to clearly understand their own values, beliefs, expectations, and assumptions. For example, one man with a physically violent borderline wife came from a conservative family that strongly disapprove of divorce. His friends counseled him to separate from her, but he felt unable to do so because of his concern about how his family would react. You may find that your beliefs and values have served you well throughout your life. Or you may find that you inherited them from your family without determining whether or not they truly reflect who you are. Either way, it is important to be guided by your OWN values--not someone else's.Resolution Phase. In this final stage, non-BPs implement their decisions and live with them. Depending upon the type of relationship, some non-BPs may, over time, change their minds many times and try different alternatives.And:....When it comes to chosen relationships, we found that the BP's willingness to admit they had a problem and seek help was by far the determining factor as to whether the couple stayed together or not....If you are looking at this right now, know that you are not alone. There are countless others who understand all you have been through for nothing. Get on the non-BP mailing list at Randi Kreger's site and buy this book NOW. It can and will save your life, whatever you decide.",1
Invisible (Ivy Malone Mystery Series #1),"She's not your average crime fighter! Ivy Malone has a curiosity that sometimes gets her into trouble, and it's only aggravated by her discovery that she can easily escape the public eye. So when vandals romp through the local cemetery, she takes advantage of her newfound anonymity and its unforeseen advantages as she launches her own unofficial investigation. Despite her oddball humor and unconventional snooping, Ivy soon becomes discouraged by her failure to turn up any solid clues. And after Ivy witnesses something ominous and unexplained, she can't resist putting her investigative powers to work again. Even the authorities' attempts to keep Ivy out of danger and her nosy neighbor's match-making schemes can't slow her down. But will the determination that fuels this persistent, quirky sleuth threaten her very safety? ""I laughed out loud.

Knife of Dreams (Wheel of Time),"The Wheel of Time is now an original series on Prime Video, starring Rosamund Pike as Moiraine! Since its debut in 1990, The Wheel of Time® by Robert Jordan has captivated millions of readers around the globe with its scope, originality, and compelling characters. The Wheel of Time turns and Ages come and go, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth returns again. In the Third Age, an Age of Prophecy, the World and Time themselves hang in the balance. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow. The dead are walking, men die impossible deaths, and it seems as though reality itself has become unstable: All are signs of the imminence of Tarmon Gai'don, the Last Battle, when Rand al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn, must confront the Dark One as humanity's only hope. Unbeknownst to Rand, Perrin has made his own truce with the Seanchan. It is a deal made with the Dark One, in his eyes, but he will do whatever is needed to rescue his wife, Faile, and destroy the Shaido who captured her. Among the Shaido, Faile works to free herself while hiding a secret that might give her her freedom or cause her destruction. And at a town called Malden, the Two Rivers longbow will be matched against Shaido spears. Fleeing Ebou Dar through Seanchan-controlled Altara with the kidnapped Daughter of the Nine Moons, Mat attempts to court the woman to whom he is half-married, knowing that she will complete that ceremony eventually. But Tuon coolly leads him on a merry chase as he learns that even a gift can have deep significance among the Seanchan Blood and what he thinks he knows of women is not enough to save him. In Caemlyn, Elayne fights to gain the Lion Throne while trying to avert what seems a certain civil war should she win the crown... In the White Tower, Egwene struggles to undermine the sisters loyal to Elaida from within... The winds of time have become a storm, and things that everyone believes are fixed in place forever are changing before their eyes. Even the White Tower itself is no longer a place of safety. Now Rand, Perrin and Mat, Egwene and Elayne, Nynaeve and Lan, and even Loial, must ride those storm winds, or the Dark One will triumph.

Parvin ""dparv""",990/1040,4.0,1129075200,"A lot better and a few good advances, but he's got one huge mess to clean up","While it still doesn't compare to the first four or five books, Knife of Dreams is probably the best novel in the Wheel of Time series since Fires of Heaven. The good news is numerous plot lines advance and the writing shows the effect of a full editing cycle. The bad news is that the good writing here oddly illuminates how much of a hole author Robert Jordan dug for himself with the mess of the previous novels - with it being made very clear even a writer of his talent probably won't be able to resolve the plethora of details even with another couple of books. I take a star off for letting a number of details and characters slip along with another half star for a pace that at times returns to near-plodding, but I'll round it up from 3.5 stars to four for the progress here that makes me have high hopes for the next book.It is outright scary to think of how many top selling authors have come and gone since Jordan started this series. In 1990, Lemony Snicket was a sophomore in college, J. K. Rowling had just taken that fateful train ride back to London, and most of the top sellers on the sci-fi/fantasy lists hadn't been published even in fan magazines. My rating here is standalone and does not reflect my frustration with how Jordan has dragged this out; read my reviews of Crossroads and New Spring if you doubt that. (Incidentally, Jordan claims to never have read a review on Amazon, having stated that ""if you're going to get your heart checked out, would you go to a doctor (professional reviewer) or walk up to a guy on the street?"" Oh well.)Although not spectacular, Knife of Dreams finally gives hope again. Without spoiling things, many plotlines raised in the last few books advance. Perrin's attempts to recover Faile, Mat's escape with and courtship of Tuon, Elayne's struggle for her crown, and a few miscellaneous issues resolve. More significantly and more satisfyingly, Jordan really does make progress on some plotlines that have been promised since the first few books - Egwene's struggle to truly be the Amyrlin Seat, the implications of Lan as Aan'allein, and miraculously, even some movement on the long (1995!) dormant Eel- and Aelfinn plotline. There are also some remarkable new point-of-view (Tuon, Loial!) perspectives that add to the details of the world without having to write hundreds of pages. Finally, the book also shows the effort of being at Tor for more than a month before publication like the last four or five novels; Jordan isn't allowed to go off into tangents - and thankfully, no major new characters get introduced - and in general the writing is generally crisper.Unfortunately, it's not enough. Jordan has created so many irrelevant plotlines and characters from the sixth book onwards that even with a workmanlike effort to clean up here the mess is still very much present. A glaring result is that the main plot - what the Dragon Reborn is doing - not only receives merely cursory attention but also doesn't show up until Chapter 18, or 385 pages into a 760 page book. The not-particularly-engaging Windfinder and Tower-divided stories get far too much coverage without moving much, a number of major characters besides Rand (like Min, Nynaeve, and Aviendha) get very little stage time with more minor players like Galina and various Shaido characters receiving far too much, other interesting plots like the Forsaken move barely at all with minimal coverage, and of all the advancements above only the Egwene line really feels satisfying. (If Jordan had advanced the other main characters as much as Egwene this would have been a much better book.) The problem is clear. The last really good WoT book, Fires of Heaven, had roughly four or five major plotlines; this has at least ten thanks to the mess of the last few books. While Jordan and his editor state unequivocally that this will be finished in one more book (thankfully planned to be completed before any more prequels), all the new material he's added makes this doubtful and is now standing directly in the way of a great wrapup.Jordan's goal was to have fans sweating by the end of the book; for me, I didn't get there as this doesn't qualify as a cliffhanger by any means. Over the summer, I actually reread all the previous books and the good news is the bad ones make more sense as part of a sequential order - and at least Jordan is somewhere close to his old form, so this isn't bad. But then again, it's not great either. Still, it deserves 3.5 stars and is worth buying in hardcover rather than waiting. For the first time in years, I look forward to the next novel.September 2007: My sympathies to Jordan's lovely wife Harriet on his recent passing. For those who are interested, the notes he left as the basis of the massive final book, A Memory of Light, will be completed and published in 3 separate books by Brandon Sanderson.",1
Cancer: 50 Essential Things to Do: Revised and Updated Edition,,,,,,,,,,0452280745,,AUOUYJS67QPQD,Robert E. Gunther,99/99,5.0,1178409600,Best book on cancer,"Of all the books I was given, bought or borrowed since I was diagnosed with cancer, this is my hands-down favorite. It is easy to read, based on one of the most extensive informal studies of survivors and, most of all, leaves you with a feeling of hope. First of all, many of the books just made my head spin - particularly when I was recovering from surgery and doing chemotherapy. This one is presented in short, powerful, easy-to-read sections that you can jump into for a few minutes every day and think about for weeks afterward. Second, it is based on real experience and deep knowledge of diverse approaches. After being given 30 days to live, Greg did what every cancer patient wants to do, he started talking to survivors. More than two decades later, he has interviewed more than 15,000 survivors. This book distills the wisdom from these interviews. It addresses conventional medical treatment, but also nutrition, exercise, support, belief and spirituality (things that your doctor may never talk to you about). It addresses issues that range from the big questions about the message of the disease to very practical approaches to reducing nausea or deciding what to eat. Finally, while most literature on cancer makes you feel confused and overwhelmed (How can you possibly do all this? Should you?), this one offers simple, authentic, actionable steps.",0
Gravity: An Introduction to Einstein's General Relativity,"Providing relevant solutions of the Einstein equation, this text introduces field equations of general relativity & their supporting mathematics. Emphasis is on the connection between observation & theory and the phenomena of gravitational physics.",['James B. Hartle'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZHgpAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=ZHgpAQAAMAAJ&q=Gravity:+An+Introduction+to+Einstein%27s+General+Relativity&dq=Gravity:+An+Introduction+to+Einstein%27s+General+Relativity&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Pearson,2003,http://books.google.com/books?id=ZHgpAQAAMAAJ&dq=Gravity:+An+Introduction+to+Einstein%27s+General+Relativity&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Science'],1.0,0805386629,70.79,AN8L1MSBP7I67,math-tutorchicago-org,99/99,5.0,1122076800,The best ~ GR ~ for beginners.,"Many beginners in GR don't have a rudimentary intuitive understanding of what 4-vectors are and how to use them in a simple physical problem. This textbook helps with that - it gives you a workout in using 4-vectors and thinking geometrically about spacetime. It teaches you the basic notions of metric, embedding diagrams, hypersurfaces, observers carrying their orthonormal bases and performing measurements, geodesics, coordinate transformations, curvature and energy tensors. Along the way, it manages to explore in detail the three most important metrics in GR: black holes (static and rotating), cosmological models of the universe and gravitational radiation. The book covers the conceptual foundations (how Einstein developed the idea), the mathematical machinery, the analysis of the historical confirmations of GR as well as many contemporary observations like gravitational lensing, cosmic background radiation, or acceleration of the universe expansion (by the way the cosmological chapters are the most logical introduction to cosmology I've seen), even future experiments like gravity probe B that is going to measure the 'frame dragging' around Earth.In the first 400 pages the book is exploring different metrics by calculating physical observable quantities like redshift, orbits, bending of light and so on using 4-vectors only. There are many examples that show you actual calculations right after a new concept is introduced and help you learn thinking in terms of 4-vectors. The usual tensor analysis, curvature, covariant derivative and Einstein equation are introduced in the last 100 pages. Each chapter has about 20 problems on average, ranging from very easy ones that familiarize you with the new concepts, average ones that train you to combine several concepts from the text, and quite hard ones (marked with [C]) that require a lot of creativity, guessing and effort on your part (sometimes you can't solve them but don't cry :). I've solved about 90% of the problems - unfortunately there aren't any answers ... Your calculus must be in prime shape, you have to know what differential is, you often have to solve integrals (for the time consuming ones use Mathematica), differential equations (only simple ones), approximate terms in formulas 'up to first order' in something and frequently convert between SI units and geometrized units (c = G = 1) but nothing fancier than that is required. The book has a web site[...]with supplements (some more theoretical derivations, nothing scary) and downloadable Mathematica notebooks that calculate Christoffels and curvature for any metric you fill in (believe me they save you a LOT of algebra).If you can spend about 6 hours per day, you can read the text and solve most of the problems in about 4 months. The text gave me many answers but often made me ask deeper questions whose answers I have to find on my own. I would say the presentation is 3/4 very clear and 1/4 is kind of fuzzy and could be improved by the author - it 'makes sense' when you read it but when you start solving the problems it turns out there are important details missing - I usually resolve these but it would be less time consuming if the text was more systematic. Solving the problems makes you really understand the concepts and is more valuable than reading the text alone! It is amazing how the book cuts through stuff that sounds 'too sophisticated' and after a few days you understand it and can even calculate it.Lastly, this text covers the beginning level of GR. You will have to read other texts like Carroll or Inverno for intermediate level and Wald for higher level.",1
Teresa of Avila: The Interior Castle (The Classics of Western Spirituality),"This 16th-century Spanish mystic is considered one of the most profound spiritual teachers in the history of Christianity.

A mystic who communed intimately with God, she had experienced a vision of ""a most beautiful crystal globe, made in the shape of a castle, and containing seven mansions, in the seventh and innermost of which was the King of Glory, in the greatest splendour, illuming and beautifying them all. . . outside the palace limits everything was foul, dark, and infested with toads, vipers and other venomous creatures."" This castle became Teresa's metaphor for the soul. ""Interior Castle"" explores each of the seven mansions in great detail. Her intended audience were the sisters who made up her cloistered religious community, however her insights offer much to the world at large.Teresa wrote reluctantly and felt that she had little to offer that had not already been said. She believed that ""Our Lord will be granting me a great favour if a single one of these nuns should find that my words help her to praise Him a little better."" She focuses on the beauty of the soul and laments that we spend so much attention on our physical body and so little on the divine spark that is within.Teresa focuses on gaining self-knowledge, but not in the way we in the 21st century interpret that term. For her, self-knowledge means coming to know the soul within. It means understanding our dependence on God and gaining humility by acknowledging that we are nothing without Him. The route to self-knowledge and entry into the interior castle comes through prayer and meditation. As one progresses through the mansions, one comes to know and long for God more and more and to reject the world and its attractions. Teresa encourages the beginner in prayer ""to labour and be resolute and prepare himself with all possible diligence to bring his will into conforming with the will of God."" She also offers encouragement: ""If, then, you sometimes fall, do not lose heart or cease striving to make progress, for even out of your fall God will bring good.""As one makes her way ever deeper into the heart of the castle, increased spiritual consolations and trials become par for the course. Many (perhaps even most) do not reach the most inner mansions in this lifetime. Teresa is quick to point out, however, that ""the Lord gives when He wills and as He wills and to whom He wills, and as the gifts are His own, this is doing no injustice to anyone."" Indeed she cautions her readers to never believe that they deserve any gift that the Lord bestows upon them, nor should we set out to obtain any consolations or mystical experiences because ""the most essential thing is that we should love God without any motive of self-interest.""Teresa was truly granted amazing gifts of insight and experience from God. While we may not share in her experience, ""Interior Castle"" offers a unique perspective into the divine within each of us. It offers a portrait of our souls and invites us into a deeper relationship with God.[...]",1

The fact that some readers feel turned off by the use of mirrors does not necessarily speak against Dr. Moody, as there were many famous people in history who used the same techniques. Discrediting Dr. Moody more or less only means to blame the messenger for the news.I came to read these books after I had lost my beloved wife to cancer. Since there were so many lose ends and since I wasn't with her at the time of her death, I really got sick of grief and of blaming myself for leaving her alone during her final hour. My doctor helped my body and my mind by prescribing antidepressants, and these books eventually cured my soul. I needed to have some 'proof' that my wife was not gone forever, and I desperately wanted to contact her to clear up the misunderstandings at her final hour.George Anderson's conversations with the other side in 'We Don't Die' and Dr. Moody's 'Life After Life' were as convincing as can be that there actually is life after death. My next step then was to contact my late wife.Whether someone actually wants to communicate with a departed loved-one, or whether someone reads this book to heal his soul, it actually makes no difference. After I was done reading, I felt that there was no more need to contact my late wife. Dr. Moody's reports of the many successful sessions and the conversations held with the departed loved-ones showed me that there are more important things in the afterlife than some minor misunderstandings. And to cure one's soul, this book is well worth the read.But if someone really wants to have contact with departed loved-ones, Dr. Moody's very high success rate with these sessions seems to prove the fact that there is more to this than just gimmicks and mirror tricks. The reason I might give his book a rating of only 4 is that Dr. Moody, in my opinion, sometimes got a bit too carried away and too excited about the surprisingly high success rate and the outcome of his studies, but that certainly is understandable...bennid@hotmail.com",1
Quines Son Los Dominicanos? Caleidoscopio Turbulento,"The Neo-Indians is a rich ethnographic study of the emergence of the neo-Indian movement—a new form of Indian identity based on largely reinvented pre-colonial cultures and comprising a diverse group of people attempting to re-create purified pre-colonial indigenous beliefs and ritual practices without the contaminating influences of modern society. There is no full-time neo-Indian. Both indigenous and non-indigenous practitioners assume Indian identities only when deemed spiritually significant. In their daily lives, they are average members of modern society, dressing in Western clothing, working at middle-class jobs, and retaining their traditional religious identities. As a result of this part-time status the neo-Indians are often overlooked as a subject of study, making this book the first anthropological analysis of the movement. Galinier and Molinié present and analyze four decades of ethnographic research focusing on Mexico and Peru, the two major areas of the movement’s genesis. They examine the use of public space, describe the neo-Indian ceremonies, provide analysis of the ceremonies’ symbolism, and explore the close relationship between the neo-Indian religion and tourism. The Neo-Indians will be of great interest to ethnographers, anthropologists, and scholars of Latin American history, religion, and cultural studies.","['Jacques Galinier', 'Antoinette Molinié']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GYngCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=GYngCwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Quines+Son+Los+Dominicanos%3F+Caleidoscopio+Turbulento&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,University Press of Colorado,2013-10-15,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GYngCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Social Science'],,0972082107,25.0,AKXXUJHJV0P2F,Milagros de los Santos,99/99,5.0,1078358400,Awesome and Honest Treatment,"I say bravo and gracias to Prof. Cambeira for this awesome book.

Now, in Sorcerer's Stone, the first basic primer on the subject, he makes alchemy's secrets and powers accessible to everyone with the desire to experience physical, mental, and spiritual transformation. By providing clear explanations, moving meditations, and hands-on experiments making tinctures and elixirs, this beautifully illustrated guide passes on the knowledge and creative energy of alchemy's magnificent discipline-sending a golden arc of learning from thousands of years in the past into your life today.Hauck present a fascinating history of alchemy - from the ancient Emerald Tablet to modern quantum chemistry - and elaborates on its arcane principles in an intimate, conversational way that anyone can understand. His portrayals of individual alchemists (like Flamel, Fulcanelli, and Isaac Newton) bring them alive and show how they built on each other's work through an ""Underground River"" of secret knowledge passed down through the ages.Moreover, Hauck makes clear that alchemy is a means of personal transformation that enables you to meet your highest potential as a human being. Although the alchemists spoke in terms of vessels, furnaces, and chemicals, they were really talking about changes taking place in their own inner nature. They worked with the archetypal energies of metals to change their own ""temperament"" from lead to gold - to rejuvenate their bodies, integrate their personalities, and perfect the very essence of their souls. The bizarre drawings and cryptic writings of the alchemists refer to specific operations that work on all levels of body, mind, and spirit. Today, enlightened physicians and healers are demonstrating that alchemical methods can protect and rejuvenate the body and even heal brain and spinal cord injuries.Complete with alchemical engravings from the Middle Ages as well as insightful charts and diagrams, this illuminating handbook will teach aspiring alchemists the true art of transformation.

Bible And Sword England and Palestine From the Bronze Age to Balfour,"From Barbara W. Tuchman, Pulitzer Prize–winning author of The Guns of August, comes history through a wide-angle lens: a fascinating chronicle of Britain’s long relationship with Palestine and the Middle East, from the ancient world to the twentieth century. Historically, the British were drawn to the Holy Land for two major reasons: first, to translate the Bible into English and, later, to control the road to India and access to the oil of the Middle East. With the lucidity and vividness that characterize all her work, Barbara W. Tuchman follows these twin spiritual and imperial motives—the Bible and the sword—to their seemingly inevitable endpoint, when Britain conquered Palestine at the conclusion of World War I. At that moment, in a gesture of significance and solemnity, the Balfour Declaration of 1917 established a British-sponsored mandate for a national home for the Jewish people. Throughout this characteristically vivid account, Tuchman demonstrates that the seeds of conflict were planted in the Middle East long before the official founding of the modern state of Israel.

I fall into the extreme end of this group, having read all 9 of her subsequent books before tackling this debut offering. Major fans of Tuchman will enjoy Bible and Sword on two levels--as a stand-alone historical work and as a window on the early development of one of the finest American-born historians.Regarding the work itself, the topic of Britain's relationship with Palestine and central role in the movement toward re-establishment of the Jewish state is fascinating. The canvas is broad, covering roughly 1,700 years from the original Christian communities in 3rd century Britain to the 1917 Balfour Declaration, which established the British policy of restoring the Jewish state to Palestine. The thesis is compelling, namely that the Balfour Declaration was the scion of twin progenitors--the Christian motivation to restore the Jews to the promised land as a prerequisite to the second coming of Christ and the imperial motivation to control the vital Mediterranean commercial route to India and the Far East. Interestingly, Tuchman makes it clear that, with several individual exceptions, these motivations had nothing to do with concern for the Jews but rather originated from the spiritual and temporal aspirations of Britain. The ebb and flow of the Britain-Palestine relationship makes for fascinating reading, covering topics such as the early Holy Land pilgrimages, the Crusades, the role of the British Navy in halting Napoleon's conquest of Palestine and the British role in propping up the Ottoman Turks.Fans of Tuchman will immediately notice similarities to her later style while being struck by several glaring differences. Her almost lyrical, figurative style, while not as refined or prevalent as additional experience would eventually allow, is on display. For example, in describing the Turkish decision to seek help from Russia in fending off rebellion, she writes, ""In his last agony, the Sultan, as a drowning man might clutch at a boa constrictor, accepted the help of his long-loathed enemy the Czar."" Unfortunately, unlike her later works, Bible and Sword is plagued by an amazing number of relatively obscure literary, political and historical allusions that leave the reader with the impression of an unproven writer seeking desperately to provide evidence of her erudition. While this can be understood in the context of an aspiring historian without the typical credentials of a PhD and university professorship, it frustrates the non-academic reader, as is evidenced by an earlier Amazon review.In the final analysis, Bible and Sword is a stimulating read, although unrefined in several respects. If you are looking to read only one or two Tuchman books, this is not the choice. But if you have an interest in the topic and/or a high level of interest in Tuchman as a writer, I highly recommend it.",1

Let Freedom Ring: Winning the War of Liberty over Liberalism,"The hard-hitting and provocative first book from the fastest-rising conservative voice in the country Sean Hannity is the hottest phenomenon in TV and talk radio today. His gutsy, take-no-prisoners interviews and commentary on the Fox News Channel’s Hannity & Colmes has made him one of the network’s most popular personalities. And his ascendance to the top of the talk radio world with ABC Radio’s The Sean Hannity Show has won him a huge and devoted conservative following, and ensured his place alongside Rush Limbaugh and Bill O’Reilly as one of the country’s most influential commentators. Now, in Let Freedom Ring, Sean Hannity offers a survey of the world—political, social, and cultural—as he sees it. Drawing on stories from his own life, and on the inspiration of political figures like Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, he recounts the experiences that have shaped his perspective on the dramatic issues that face America today: • Terrorism and National Security • The Economy • Liberal Media Bias • Education • Faith, Character, and the Family As America meets the challenges of the post-9/11 world—abroad and at home—Sean Hannity’s position is clear: “We are engaged in a war of ideas.

There is a good reason why I didn't get very far and I will get to that.I read the book ""How to win friends and influence people"" years ago and to this day, I believe it was one of the greatest books I have ever read. The techniques I learned from that book truly did change my life and improve me as a person. Only recently someone suggested to me that if I enjoyed Dale Carnegie's book then I would definitely enjoy ""The 7 habits of highly effective people"" as well. Now I generally am not a fan of ""self help"" type books but after reading some very positive reviews on the internet I decided I would buy it and read it. I purchased the book on a Friday and returned it on Saturday. Let me explain why.Within a few pages of my beginning the book Covey began making references to his faith, the power of prayer, God and so on. (Later I found out he is an active member of the Church of Latter Day Saints). Sorry, but as soon as someone starts bringing religion, spirituality, prayer, higher power or whatever else into the discussion I pretty much tune out and lose interest and confidence in anything else they have to say. Such people aren't dealing in science, facts, evidence and reason. They are in my mind, basically mystics and they are potentially dangerous. I won't go too deeply into it here because I don't want to offend anybody but I've ZERO time for religion or religious zealots. As far as I'm concerned anyone who uses religion to bolster their argument for or against anything or tries to covertly slip it into the discussion of other matters is an automatic write off and someone whose advice I make a point of deliberately ignoring.Some may gain some benefit from this book and if they do then that is fantastic and I am happy for them. Just be aware that Covey tries to sneakily interject religion into what is supposed to be a self help manual. For me that makes him a total write off.",1
Refuting evolution 2,"In 1925 a schoolteacher was taken to court for teaching evolution in the public school system. The famous Scopes Trial pushed Darwin to the forefront of our society. In 1962, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that school prayer is unconstitutional. In 1998 the National Academy of Sciences published and distributed a book to public schools and other institutions entitled Teaching About Evolution and the Nature of Science. This publication was designed to persuade and assist teachers to present the theory as fact and counter anti-evolutionist students. So, now we have digressed from the legalities of teaching evoution in our schools to a single mindset that evolution, though unproven, is the only answer to the question of human origins. And we wonder why we are having problems with children in our public school systems!",['Jonathan D.

They are probably trying to separate scarce facts from the copious cornucopia of creationist distortions and crank conspiracy theories that infest ""Refuting Evolution 2"" subtitled ""What PBS and the Scientific Community Don't Want You to Know.""This sequel to ""Refuting Evolution"" (reviewed separately) only confirms that farce is tragedy the second time around. The rubber-band reality of this tract is glaringly evident with Mr. Sarfati attempts to prove that creationism is science. As an employee of Answers in Genesis (AiG) Sarfati had to sign a ""Statement of Faith"" that, among other things, includes the following:BASICS ARTICLE 3: ""The account of origins presented in Genesis is a simple but factual presentation of actual events and therefore provides a reliable framework for scientific research into the question of the origin and history of life, mankind, the Earth and the universe.""GENERAL ARTICLE 6: ""No apparent, perceived or claimed evidence in any field, including history and chronology, can be valid if it contradicts the Scriptural record.""Based on these rather frank admissions the only conspiracy is between AiG and Sarfati, not PBS and the ""Scientific Community."" By these standards Alchemy and Astrology (among others) - both thoroughly discredited and discarded by global scientific community - would be valid ""science,"" and wizarding and witchcraft would be perfectly acceptable examples of ""technology."" Sarfati knows his cause is hopeless when he has to redefine science and the scientific method just to sneak into the tent.Since a chapter by chapter refutation would be longer than the book let's focus on one topic: ""Refuting Evolution 2"" categorically claims that evolution cannot ""increase genetic information content."" If this claim falls the entire book collapses.Unfortunately for Sarfati, none of his arguments based on creationist ""information theory"" (with apologies to Shannon, Kolmogorov, and Chaitin), adequately address the obvious increase in information that can occur when a gene duplicates, and the two copies undergo independent mutations leading to two genes with somewhat different functions. Gene duplication, mutation, and selection are all known to occur due to natural biochemical processes in a variety of organisms studied in laboratories around the world.Many gene families are known with members that encode proteins having related structure and related but distinct function. Each family can be explained by multiple gene duplications followed by random mutation and differentiation of the functions of the individual gene copies. Any expansion from a single primordial gene to a large family of genes with distinct functions clearly represents an increase in genetic information.One instance of gene duplication resulting in additional information and functionality is the hemoglobin/myoglobin family. An ur-gene for an oxygen-carrying protein duplicated, leading to myoglobin which oxygenates muscles, and hemoglobin which carries oxygen in red blood cells. A subsequent duplication of the hemoglobin gene resulted in alpha and beta forms. Additional duplications produced hemoglobin-alpha and hemoglobin-beta gene clusters. The genes within these clusters are different, as a result of subsequent mutation after duplication, and express themselves at different stages of development. Gene duplication and subsequent divergence are observed in the laboratory - consequently an evolutionary causation based on processes known to occur today is inherently more plausible than invoking a superfluous supernatural agent or agency.A large part of the increased information in our genomes, compared with those of ""lower"" organisms, results from such gene duplication, followed by independent evolution and differentiation of duplicated copies into multiple genes with distinct functions. Any information theory analysis which ignores these naturally occurring and readily observable mechanisms, and then goes on to claim that any increase in genetic information is impossible, is fundamentally flawed and thoroughly dishonest.Like a cheap parlor magician Sarfati diverts your attention away from what he doesn't want you to see, know, or hear. He commits errors of omission and commission, and calls the resulting fable fact. So much for integrity when ""Statement of Faith"" based creationist apologetics, and the dogma it enforces, matter more than the truth.Earth to Sarfati: Evolution is still a scientific fact. Get over it. Playing ""whack-a-mole"" with you is tiring and inane. Besides I hear you're much better at chess.",1

The Ancient Hebrew Language and Alphabet: Understanding the Ancient Hebrew Language of the Bible Based on Ancient Hebrew Culture and Thought,"The Hebrew Bible, called the ""Tenach"" by Jews and ""Old Testament"" by Christians, was originally written in the Hebrew language using an ancient pictographic, or paleo-Hebrew, script. Through the study of this ancient language and script the words of the Bible will come alive to the reader in a way never seen before. This book will examine the origins and history of the ancient Hebrew language and script and their close relationship to the culture of the ancient Hebrews. Included are detailed charts of the evolution of the ancient Hebrew script as well as many other related Semitic and non-Semitic scripts. Also included are the details of the root system of the Hebrew language, and a lexicon of ancient Hebrew roots to assist the reader of the Bible with finding the original cultural context for many Hebrew words.",['Jeff A.

Even less plausibly, he holds that the Hebrew language and its script must have appeared simultaneously when God created Adam with a mature knowledge of the spoken and written language. He claims to have demonstrated the truth of this latter view, but I cannot locate any such demonstration (see below on standards of proof).As the above might suggest would be the case, Benner combines these specific claims about Hebrew with unargued acceptance of the Genesis story - including the Tower of Babel story about the origin of linguistic diversity - as uncontroversially and literally true. This is a one-sidedly fundamentalist treatment of the issues in question, and readers with other views on these issues will be unable to accept it by way of background (given Benner's failure to argue adequately for his own stance and the well-known weakness of such positions in scientific and historical terms).In addition, Benner's discussion of linguistic matters more generally (other than some of the specifics of Hebrew) appears naive and ill-informed. His standards of proof appear too loose. Further, he accepts (in general terms) the idea, most notoriously promoted in recent times by Mozeson, that many words in English and other non-Semitic languages derive from Hebrew - on the basis of 'evidence' which in no way meets the very robust criteria which have long been known to linguists. This alone suggests that he does not understand historical linguistics.Indeed, Benner fails to refer to established linguistic scholarship, and instead invokes fringe and semi-fringe writers in support of some of his claims, apparently treating these authors as authoritative. This is in fact not unusual among linguistic amateurs; they seem to locate the relatively sober fringe thinker or the maverick on the fringe of professional linguistics much more readily than the genuine mainstream scholar. In this case, Benner notably invokes Fano, who was one of the members of a mid-C20 breakaway Italian school of non-scientific linguists influenced by the idealist philosophy of Croce. Fano in fact rejected Croce's more extreme ideas; but he is still conspicuously non-mainstream in international terms, and he cannot be treated as authoritative.Benner also has a marked tendency not to distinguish clearly enough between generally accepted points and his own controversial claims. A reader without prior knowledge of the structure of Hebrew would not be able to disentangle these two aspects of the material.In producing this version of his material, Benner has failed to take on board or even engage with the many crucial linguistic points which tell against his account of the development of Hebrew and its script. I myself made many of these points in correspondence with him but apparently to no avail.All this will have the consequence that a linguistically trained person who comes across the material will surely (and rightly) dismiss it, as will other non-fundamentalist scholars. At best, some of Benner's very particular proposals might possibly be valid, but these are lost amid the highly unsatisfactory general treatment of the issues.",1
How the Irish Became White,"'...from time to time a study comes along that truly can be called ‘path breaking,’ ‘seminal,’ ‘essential,’ a ‘must read.’ How the Irish Became White is such a study.' John Bracey, W.E.B. Du Bois Department of Afro-American Studies, University of Massachussetts, Amherst The Irish came to America in the eighteenth century, fleeing a homeland under foreign occupation and a caste system that regarded them as the lowest form of humanity. In the new country – a land of opportunity – they found a very different form of social hierarchy, one that was based on the color of a person’s skin. Noel Ignatiev’s 1995 book – the first published work of one of America’s leading and most controversial historians – tells the story of how the oppressed became the oppressors; how the new Irish immigrants achieved acceptance among an initially hostile population only by proving that they could be more brutal in their oppression of African Americans than the nativists. This is the story of How the Irish Became White.",['Noel Ignatiev'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fqUAzhs-FLEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=fqUAzhs-FLEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=How+the+Irish+Became+White&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Routledge,2012-11-12,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fqUAzhs-FLEC&source=gbs_api,['History'],,0415918251,,A2PKF6AK6D7YI4,Michael Sheehan,99/142,1.0,1061942400,Those Troubling Irish,"Noel Ignatiev. How the Irish Became WhiteIgnatiev&#65533;s stated purpose, in the broadest sense, in writing this work, was an attempt to examine immigrant assimilation and the evolution of an American working class. On a narrower level he sought to divine why the Irish Catholics, an oppressed race in their own land, became part of an oppressor race in the United States. His thesis is that the Irish immigrant made a conscious decision to adopt Anglo-Saxon racism in order to gain a foot up in a competitive society -- to the disadvantage of Afro-Americans and the frustration of the formation of a united working class in America. He failed in his attempt on both accounts.Eric Foner is a Marxist historian. Ignatiev is a wannabe. Foner marshals his evidence, ignores the irrelevant, and analyses the meaningful from a leftist prospective. Ignatiev amasses a great deal of stuff, is unable to cull the meaningless and, without any sense of organization, tries to cram the results into his fevered preconceptions of racial relations in the nineteenth century. The result would be comical if in doing so he had not slandered an oppressed people striving to enter the American working class against all odds. &#65533;Ignatiev created a racial construct -- the Irish &#65533; that fails to account for the substantial differences and interests between the Irish in America and those in Ireland, between Irish-Americans and native-born Irish, and between Irish Catholics and Irish Protestants. Much of Ignatiev&#65533;s evidence relates to events prior to the Great Famine and the mass migration of destitute Irish Catholics to America. The net effect of this conglomeration is to obscure and to trivialize the struggle of Irish Catholics to climb out of the depths of poverty while burdening them with the racial and religious bigotry of their former oppressors. He criticizes the Irish for not taking up the abolitionist cause and labels them as racists for their failure to do so. Ignatiev seems unaware that a substantial number of abolitionists were white supremacists who believed that the superior Anglo-Saxon race abased itself by enslaving the inferior black race. It never occurred to Ignatiev that the apparent indifference of the Irish immigrants to slavery was not motivated by racism but that these people, engaged in a hand to mouth struggle for survival, were trying to avoid the stigma of &#65533;No Irish Need Apply.&#65533; &#65533;Ignatiev&#65533;s publisher makes the claim that the author reveals &#65533;how the Irish used labor unions, the Catholic Church and the Democratic party to help gain and secure their newly found place in the White Republic.&#65533; This assertion raises the question of whether or not the publisher ever read this work for there is not one reference to the Catholic Church and its myriad institutions of charity and education which the Irish Catholics both established and exploited in order to raise themselves from poverty to membership in the working class and beyond. &#65533;It is said that the empty drum resonates the loudest. Ignatiev at every opportunity, in this work and elsewhere, proclaims his abhorrence for racism. Racism, that is, as demonstrated by others. Indeed he is so busy berating others he fails to note the mote in his own eye. Witness Ignatiev&#65533;s stereotyping of the Irish. Huck-Finn must have been Irish because his father was the town drunk. [p. 58.] Witness Ignatiev&#65533;s belittling of the contribution of Irish born volunteers fighting for the Union in the Civil War. &#65533; The number of Irish who took part in the [New York draft] riots was not less than the number who wore the blue uniform.&#65533; [p. 88.] According to official records more than one hundred thousand native born Irish fought for the North in that war, thousands of whom died in combat. According to Iver Bernstein in The New York City Draft Riots, a source favorably cited by Ignatiev, there was far fewer people engaged in those riots, Irish immigrants, German immigrants and native-born Americans combined. &#65533;In summation the book fails both as a work of history and social commentary. It adds nothing, save confusion, to what Theodore W. Allen had already written in 1994, about Irish Catholic immigrants in the final two chapters of his work The Invention of the White Race.",0
Against the Modern World: Traditionalism and the Secret Intellectual History of the Twentieth Century,"Against the Modern World is the first history of Traditionalism, an important yet surprisingly little-known twentieth-century anti-modern movement. Comprising a number of often secret but sometimes very influential religious groups in the West and in the Islamic world, it affected mainstream and radical politics in Europe and the development of the field of religious studies in the United States, touching the lives of many individuals. French writer Rene Guenon rejected modernity as a dark age and sought to reconstruct the Perennial Philosophy - the central truths behind all the major world religions. Guenon stressed the urgent need for the West's remaining spiritual and intellectual elite to find personal and collective salvation in the surviving vestiges of ancient religious traditions. A number of disenchanted intellectuals responded to his call. In Europe, America, and the Islamic world, Traditionalists founded institutes, Sufi brotherhoods, Masonic lodges, and secret societies. Some attempted unsuccessfully to guide Fascism and Nazism along Traditionalist lines; others later participated in political terror in Italy. Traditionalist ideas were the ideological cement for the alliance of anti-democratic forces in post-Soviet Russia, and in the Islamic world entered the debate about the relationship between Islam and modernity. Although its appeal in the West was ultimately limited, Traditionalism has wielded enormous influence in religious studies, through the work of such Traditionalists as Ananda Coomaraswamy, Huston Smith, Mircea Eliade, and Seyyed Hossein Nasr.",['Mark Sedgwick'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kbARDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=kbARDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Against+the+Modern+World:+Traditionalism+and+the+Secret+Intellectual+History+of+the+Twentieth+Century&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Oxford University Press,2009-07-13,http://books.google.com/books?id=kbARDAAAQBAJ&dq=Against+the+Modern+World:+Traditionalism+and+the+Secret+Intellectual+History+of+the+Twentieth+Century&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],,0195152972,50.0,ARAISMFZG7VP8,Leonard Fox,99/138,1.0,1099526400,Form without substance,"It is ironic that this book, which purports to expose the ""secret intellectual history of the twentieth century"" provides an excellent justification for the Traditionalist antipathy toward the profane character of contemporary Western society. The thinly veiled attitude of hostility to Traditionalism, and the patronizing contempt for its insights, with which the text is permeated, reveals far more about the author than about his subject matter. Masquerading as a work of scholarship, the book is little more than a collection of ad hominem attacks on some of the greatest intellectual and spiritual minds of the past hundred years, without any attempt to evaluate objectively the profound ideas developed by these individuals. It is more usual to find material of this sort - much of it based on gossip, rumor, and innuendo - in a supermarket tabloid than in a publication by Oxford University Press.It is quite difficult to write a serious review of a book that contains nothing serious except pretensions. Despite its scholarly facade (69 pages of notes and an 8-page bibliography), the work is essentially form without substance. A few comments would perhaps be useful, however:A large amount of space in Sedgwick's book is devoted to Frithjof Schuon and some of his closest associates, e.g., Titus Burckhardt, Leo Schaya, Seyyed Hossein Nasr, Martin Lings, and Whitall Perry. A glance at the book's bibliography will indicate the extent of the author's research into their writings: Of the more than twenty books by Frithjof Schuon, only three appear there (in addition to the limited circulation autobiography with which Sedgwick is so preoccupied); Burckhardt's ""Fez, City of Islam"" is listed, but not his ""Introduction to Sufism,"" or his ""Alchemy: Science of the Cosmos, Science of the Soul,"" or any of his translations of Arabic texts; Schaya's ""The Universal Meaning of the Kabbalah"" is absent, as are Lings's ""Book of Certainty"" and Perry's monumental ""Treasury of Traditional Wisdom,"" to name just a few of some of the most important contributions to Traditionalist literature. Although Sedgwick writes at length about ""Etudes Traditionelles,"" he does not even mention ""Studies in Comparative Religion,"" the most significant English-language Traditionalist journal, in which articles that were to become classics of Traditionalist thought were published.It is amusing to see that, in the spirit of ""the reign of quantity and the signs of the times,"" Sedgwick appears to equate the value of a book with its sales record. He says, in speaking of the 220 books by ""Schuon and 23 other identified followers"" published between 1950 and 1999, that ""none [had] sales as impressive as Merton's 'Seven Storey Mountain' or Smith's 'Religions of Man.' "" In the next paragraph, he notes that ""only a few"" of what he calls ""hard"" Traditionalist books ""achieved significant sales"" (p. 167). Sedgwick thus betrays his fundamental ignorance of the fact that Traditionalism is not and has never been a spiritual perspective intended for the ""broad masses.""It would be possible quite easily to expose the cover-to-cover ignorance and trivialization of great ideas that Sedgwick so blatantly reveals in this book, but it would require far more space than Amazon permits for a review. From the standpoint of purely external appearance, though, it should be said that this book was appallingly edited and proofread. Indeed, it is difficult to believe that a publisher of such eminence as Oxford would permit the work to be printed as it was. There are typographical errors, incorrect diacritics (especially in Romanian), solecisms, questionable translations, omitted and duplicated words, misspelled names, and other inexcusable mistakes.Mr. Sedgwick seems to be critical of the Traditionalist tendency to see beyond the forms of exoteric religion to the underlying divine truth present in the nucleus of those forms. The greatest mystics of all religions, however, have also been ""guilty"" of this:Meister Eckhart says: ""We shall find God in everything alike, and find God always alike in everything."" And Ibn al-`Arabi writes: ""My heart has opened unto every form: it is a pasture for gazelles, a cloister for Christian monks, a temple for idols, the Ka`ba of the pilgrim, the tables of the Torah, and the book of the Qur'an. I practice the religion of Love; in whatsoever directions its caravans advance, the religion of Love shall be my religion and my faith.""",1

For years the right-wing has had its own way in the national media, all the while claiming ""liberal media"" over and over again so many times from so many sources that most people believe it.This book doesn't waste much time on that (for the Liberal Media canard, see Eric Alterman's masterpiece). ""The Clinton Wars"" does have to visit the media frequently, because that is where the offensive part of the war took place. In many cases, as Blumenthal points out, the Clintons were permitted no defense whatsoever. Reading this story makes you wonder how they survived, even though you know by now how it turned out!If you are turned off by political hate-books (like Coulter, Noonan, Hannity and others) you won't be disappointed by Blumenthal. If his narrative seems a bit sharp at times, it is only because Clinton's enemies were so hate filled that it seems that even to fully describe them there is no way to not appear partisan. Blumenthal is always careful to back up his assertions with footnoted facts and direct quotes, and so far I have not found any faking of footnotes of the type that were discovered in Ann Coulter's book.This will all be very unhappy reading for the demographic for whom it is an article of faith that the Clintons are vile, corrupt power-mongers who only ""got away with it"" and were never innocent of anything in their lives. ""The Clinton Wars"" takes the trouble to go back in history to explain how this mind-set developed as well, back to FDR's time and before. History was my least favorite subject in high school, but it wouldn't have been had this book been around.As it is, I'm glad that Blumenthal got this on the record.",1

"Orthodoxy,","G. K. Chesterton meditates on the value of the Christian faith to society in this celebrated essay Inspired by a friend to examine his personal philosophy on religion, G. K. Chesterton walks readers through his conversion to Christianity, which was based on a rational consideration of fact. Orthodoxy considers the logical and scholarly arguments in favor of the Christian faith and presents an impassioned argument for the church as a positive, liberal organization. One of the strongest apologias ever written, it is a critical triumph from a renowned author, poet, journalist, and philosopher, whose own spiritual journey provides the foundation for this fascinating treatise on religious belief.

This particular book is regularly referred to and relied upon in evangelical works on all sorts of subjects. As such, it is a book that evangelicals should read and take notice of. And clearly, it is a book that many Roman Catholics will empathize with due to its clear advancement of the Roman Catholic church as the purest and most correct source of religion.As has been pointed out by others, in advancing Christian orthodoxy, Chesterton takes a decidedly unorthodox approach. Instead of advancing objective evidences or elaborate philosophical arguments, he chooses instead an approach that is actually quite funny in a way - an approach that at its core, resembles Calvinistic presuppositionalism. This is funny since Chesterton, on more than one occasion in this book, flippantly rejects all things Calvinistic, yet I found his entire book to be rooted in an apologetic approach that is in many ways similar to Van Til. He asserts, consistently with Van Tillianism, that those who offer objections to Christianity fundamentally lack an epistemic basis to do so since their objections presuppose and rely upon Christian values, the origin of which they later argue against. This is brought out very clearly in his 'Paradoxes of Christianity' chapter where he critiques the hopeless inconsistency of Christianity's critics. This was a real treat to read.In the end, Chesterton advances the view that wonder, happiness, joy, and a proper balance between optimism and pessimism can only be found in Christianity. This conclusion is based upon his own experience, and bolstered by many hypothetical and theoretical examples meant to further the point.I gave the book 4 stars instead of 5 for reasons that others might deem unfair. While there were many sections of this book that were very insightful and on point, there were also sections where Chesterton seemed to be rambling toward no particular end. This might be an unfair criticism because the book was not meant to be a systematic apologetic for Christianity, but instead a semi-autobiographical account that charts Chesterton's own thought process. As a result, the reader will also notice that Orthodoxy is a work that is nearly devoid of Biblical references, much less exegesis. I found this problematic precisely because one could read this book, conclude that Chesterton was completely right in everything he said, and still be able to reject Christianity completely since the book did not interact at all with Biblical truths.Lastly, I must say having read this book, it is no surprise to me that a guy like Philip Yancey would be bonkers over it (Yancey wrote the introduction to the edition of the book I read). Chesterton was a man who embraced Roman Catholicism in a Protestant environment, and did so defiantly. In many ways, Chesterton writes as if he is an army of one. Not coincidentally, this also tends to be the attitude that Yancey has adopted relative to his views within evangelicalism. As such, Yancey's introduction to this book mindlessly strikes out against other evangelicals who don't see the world the way he does, and it is clear that his inspiration lies at least in part in Chesterton. I couldn't help but get the feeling that both of these individuals, to greater or lesser degrees, came to embrace the idea of being contrary for the sake of being contrary, and then justifying it with language extolling the virtue of being revolutionary, as if this is supposed to be an end in itself. It is admittedly hard for me to have much respect for such views, and maybe I'm misreading both men. But that was certainly the indication I got after reading this book, and it is a position that is not only anti-intellectual, but easily becomes completely self-serving.In the end, the book is a good read which makes many insightful points. Chesterton clearly believed that truth should translate to joy and wonder. This is certainly a message that all believers should pay attention to, and to this end, I think this book succeeds.",1
His Dark Materials Trilogy,"Northern Lights introduces Lyra, an orphan, who lives in a parallel universe in which science, theology and magic are entwined. Lyra's search for a kidnapped friend uncovers a sinister plot involving stolen children and turns into a quest to understand a mysterious phenomenon called Dust. In The Subtle Knife she is joined on her journey by Will, a boy who possesses a knife that can cut windows between worlds. As Lyra learns the truth about her parents and her prophesied destiny, the two young people are caught up in a war against celestial powers that ranges across many worlds and leads to a thrilling conclusion in The Amber Spyglass. The epic story Pullman tells is not only a spellbinding adventure featuring armoured polar bears, magical devices, witches and daemons, it is also an audacious and profound re-imagining of Milton's Paradise Lost. An utterly entrancing blend of metaphysical speculation and bravura storytelling, HIS DARK MATERIALS is a monumental and enduring achievement.",['Philip Pullman'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xl9fkQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=xl9fkQEACAAJ&dq=His+Dark+Materials+Trilogy&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Everyman Paperback Classics,2011,http://books.google.com/books?id=xl9fkQEACAAJ&dq=His+Dark+Materials+Trilogy&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],27.0,B000GSDWJW,,A2S7K3TJ3VYWXV,"Mr. Eclectic ""Brian""",99/133,3.0,1038441600,A great read but should be rated PG.,"As a teacher and a lover of good books, I have conflicting opinions of ""His Dark Materials."" For pure ""good read"" value, I would consider this series on par with the Harry Potter series: not great literature, but well-crafted and compelling. Unlike the Potter series, which borrows heavily from many different existing characters and works, ""His Dark Materials"" is pure and original in its imaginative scope. Characters are very realistic, each possessing the same mixture of good and bad qualites we all possess. The plot twists and turns in a manner that is completely unpredictable. For these and many other reasons, the series is remarkably realistic for a fantasy piece, but this is where my problem with the series begins.Like Judy Blume before him, Mr. Pullman and his publishers have decided to market very controversial material to minors without providing warning to parents as to just what the books contain. While Blume's books contain realistic and often graphic depictions of teen and pre-teen sexuality and other controversial topics of interest to young people, Mr. Pullman has decided to use this blending of realistic and fantasy elements to take on religion.I am not a religious person myself, but even I was shocked by the lack of respect and even contempt for anything resembling organized religion that Mr. Pullman displays in this trilogy (except Shamanism, with which he doesn't seem to have a problem). Ironically, the knife Mr. Pullman uses to skewer religion is anything but subtle. I could cite multiple instances of his treatment, but to do so would ruin a good story for those interested in reading it. Let it suffice to say that anti-religious sentiments pervade the series to the point that religion itself is the ""dark force in the universe."" I found this premise fascinating, but then I am a thirty-something year old man who can enjoy a story without automatically accepting its underlying premise. I worry that many of the young people who read and enjoy ""His Dark Materials"" will find this literary Trojan horse so compelling that they actually rush to embrace the Greeks as they appear from within. Parents struggling to provide religious and moral training for their children are done a disservice when authors like Mr. Pullman write a book the purpose of which is to undermine those very efforts. For the record, I am not assuming Mr. Pullman's intent with regards to the intentions of his trilogy. I actually saw an interview with him on television in which he spelled out the anti-religious underpinnings of ""His Dark Materials.""To sum it all up, I'm not for censoring anything. The story is a good one. I really enjoyed it. I just don't think it should be marketed to young people. It should, instead, be marketed to adults who bring some additional wisdom and perspective to the work.I understand that a movie version of ""His Dark Materials"" is already in the works. If you think the protests of the super-conservative religious types were loud when the Potter craze began, wait until the vast numbers of religious moderates join the fray when they find out what their children have been learning about God and religion in Mr. Pullman's wildly popular books. Let's hope the film industry is responsible enough not to market this film adaptation directly to children. Okay, I know I'm not being realistic. It won't be long before we see the assassin priest, decrepit God, and gay angel couple action figures in our local stores along with the picket signs of many good people whom Mr. Pullman purposely intended to insult and offend. They, of course, will look like narrow-minded, intolerant idiots and Mr. Pullman will become the media's latest downtrodden first amendment crusader. He will also be a multi-millionaire.Well played, Mr. Pullman.",1

NEW EARTH,"The 10th anniversary edition of A New Earth with a new preface by Eckhart Tolle. With his bestselling spiritual guide The Power of Now, Eckhart Tolle inspired millions of readers to discover the freedom and joy of a life lived “in the now.” In A New Earth, Tolle expands on these powerful ideas to show how transcending our ego-based state of consciousness is not only essential to personal happiness, but also the key to ending conflict and suffering throughout the world. Tolle describes how our attachment to the ego creates the dysfunction that leads to anger, jealousy, and unhappiness, and shows readers how to awaken to a new state of consciousness and follow the path to a truly fulfilling existence.

It is mostly a fantasy that attempts to recapture human infancy experiences and claim that they are reality. Like many gurus of this sort who use such rhetoric about the 'ego,' 'ultimate reality,' 'space,' 'time,' and 'oneness,' the main idea is a regression to an infantile state of mind where there are no inhibitions and thus no morality, as well as no sense of self as a separate individual.

With this at least this reviewer is at one with Wilson. Postmodernism places great store on style and surface appearance rather than an argument for a claim of universal truth. But here is the irony. Wilson's book is written in style. It is engaging, non-polemical, full of impressive knowledge of many and varied kinds. Is this why it has won the prize? It can't be because he has made his case for he hasn't!What is the case he seeks to make? In contrast the post-modern outlook Wilson believes in universal truth. However the burden of this book is to take this conviction further than many would want. He believes that all truth can in principle be attained by the reductionist methods of natural science. That is to say that he believes that our conscious awareness of our surroundings, our apparent free-will, the personal knowledge we have of one another, our appreciation of beauty, our perception of right and wrong etc can all be reduced to the laws of physics. In other words he believes that all ways of knowing can in the end be reduced to reductionist science. He is then what some would call a `hard materialist' or `hard naturalist'. He pleads guilty to `ontological reductionism' and `scientism'. (page 9). However unlike Dawkins and Leakey and others, he is not, an anti-religious polemicist. He even concedes that transcendentalism may finally win the argument. However the purpose of his book it to put the case against transcendentalism and for materialist reductionism. He believes there may possibly be a God but this God has no continuing relationship with creation and therefore He is not relevant to anything we do or know . Wilson is then, as he describes himself, a Deist (in the modern sense of the word.)By referring to Kant and other well known philosophers he gives the impression that he is well read in philosophy. This for the case he is making, of course, would be essential. However it is only an impression - though an impression that must have impressed those who award the Pulitzer Prize. His arguments show he has not really got to grips with the age-old discussions. With reference to 20th century philosophy he devotes several pages in chapter 4 to Logical Positivism. It was a form of atheist materialist philosophy that came to prominence in the first half of the 20th century. It failed and Wilson knows that it fails. However he claims that it failed only because it was not known how the brain works. This he tells us is the `whole story' of its failure. What is extraordinary about Wilson's claim is that the state of scientific knowledge had nothing whatsoever to do with the failure of Logical Positivism. It failed because, at its heart, was the so-called Verification Principle. This stated that any statement that cannot in principle be tested by experiment is meaningless. (So, it claimed that moral and aesthetic judgements are meaningless). It was later realised (by Wittgenstein and others) that the Verification Principle itself cannot be tested by experiment and therefore, on its own terms, is meaningless. The failure of Logical Positivism had nothing to do with the then lack of knowledge of the brain and everything to do with it being a self-refuting philosophy.Over and over again his main thesis boils down to the argument that since scientific reductionism has answered many of our questions about the natural world it will, one day, be able to answer all questions. However that simply does not follow! It could conceivably be argued that science's great success makes it possible that one day it will answer all questions. Even this argument for a possible outcome could only be valid if it could be shown that the advance of science is reducing the sense of mystery about the nature of reality. Many would argue that the very reverse is the case. For example with the advent of the very successful quantum physics the mystery of what lies at the foundation of the natural world deepens greatly. The discovery of DNA may well have greatly advanced our understanding of what life is but it exposes new mysteries that previous generations could never have thought of. More of that below.A serious gap in his thesis is his failure even to refer to the great physical chemist and philosopher of science Michael Polanyi. Since Polanyi's main contribution to epistemology runs directly counter to Wilson's views, he, at least, should have tackled Polanyi's arguments. Polanyi believed that it is only living conscious beings that know things. (Books and computers may contain information but do not themselves know anything). Polanyi's conviction was that any theory of knowledge, which reduces the conscious person to mere lifeless atoms in motion, undermines not only the concept of person but also undermines knowledge itself because it is only living conscious beings that know things. His conviction was that all knowledge is personal knowledge but that we persons know things in a different way than we know other persons. We know other persons when we talk to one another living and working in their presence. We could never reach that knowledge by dissecting people - however far our science had advanced. Thus personal knowledge of one another is not reached by reductionist science but is nevertheless real knowledge. Good science in the widest sense uses methods of knowing that are appropriate to the object we seek to know. It is now, and always will be, inappropriate to use reductionist science to know other people. It would not only be inhumane but in the fullest sense of the word unscientific. It is in personal knowledge of one another that we can begin to learn those things that are in principle unknowable by reductionist science - namely what it is like to be that other person. My experience of me as `I' cannot be publicly examined but can nevertheless be revealed to other people with whom I have a personal relationship. My subjective experience of me as `I' in my relation to the outside world is what I call my self-awareness and consciousness. These inherently subjective experiences are what philosophers call `qualia'.However if we presuppose materialism before we begin to examine reality, ultimately there will be no alternative to Edward Wilson's view. But why should we presuppose it? As noted above the farther reductionist science advances into knowledge of the material world the more not less mystery it uncovers.To argue against transcendentalism one must surely tackle such ancient questions as to where the universe came from. This is not a question about a gap in our knowledge of how the universe works but a question that in principle lies at the boundary of science and any transcendent world. I am surprised that Wilson does not tackle it, especially as he seems to claim that one day there will be no questions at all that science cannot answer. (Page 10) He skirts the related question: Why is the universe ordered?' with the words: &quot;fortunate comprehensibility of the universe&quot;, and with a description of the world as &quot;surprisingly well ordered&quot;. (Page 50) The adjective `fortunate' and the adverb `surprisingly' immensely underrate the issue. Surely we must agree with Einstein that the origin of the comprehensibility of the universe is itself incomprehensible. In other words science's presupposition of order is right but it cannot say where that order came from. If Einstein is correct then there is no way that Wilson's thesis can be correct. It fails at nature's foundation.It is in his treatment of mind and consciousness that he tackles another fundamental issue. If he can explain these in materialistic terms he has gone along way to showing that one day beauty, culture, morality and religion will all be explicable from physics. Before I get to his treatment of mind and consciousness there is something to be said about the nature of life and evolution. Wilson gives us a very impressive description of the cells of life.",1

The book is thorough, vividly written and steady and has, obviously, already been assailed by the right wing punditocracy largely because Blumenthal actually admires Clinton and measures the man's very real achievements (while also being quite forthright about Clinton's missteps, particularly his incoherent first two years in office.) But Blumenthal has also ticked off another power nexus -- that of the mainstream media. Why? Because Blumenthal, a former reporter for The Washington Post and The New Yorker knows how the game was played, and he names names, providing an absolutley devastating analysis of how big media companies like The New York Times, The Post, Time, Newsweek, et al, were duped by dirty tricksters on the radical right; how the Whitewater story was concocted by Republican gamesters during the '92 election and how, after Clinton's election, those gamesters used Jeff Gerth at the supposedly 'liberal' NY Times to do their dirty work by foisting the story into the national mainstream. With results we know now.Attacks on Blumenthal, from Times' editors, Newsweek's Isikoff strike a false and shrill (and hugely defensive) note. Blumenthal has the goods on these characters. The smoke has cleared, and as they say ""history will judge."" Those media bigfeet who became so usefully available to the Republican propaganda machine do not like now to have their bad behavior brought back up. Thus, the tenor of reviews claiming the Clinton era is all 'ancient history' and we should let the past be past.Significantly, the one dispassionate and also hugely favorable review of this book was written not by a journalist forced to confront the press's near-treasonous conduct during the Clinton years, but by an historian, Robert Dallek.",1
Atlas Shrugged,,,,,,,,,,B000PWMT1G,,A2NACIQH1P8J01,Hoke,99/128,5.0,1154563200,"Read Philosophy, do not fear it","Ayn Rand's philosophy is known as objectivism. It is essentially having a objective reason and purpose for every action you commit.Atlas Shrugged is one of two major novels that outlines her entire philosophy while trying to show how it would be applied. That is why this book deserves a 5 star rating. Any philosopher can give generic ideas with no application. Rand puts it all on the line to show exactly how she means her philosophy to be interpreted.The student of philosophy will be able to understand her philosophy quite clearly after reading this. If you agree with her philosophy you should encourage others to read this book. If this book is so clearly wrong then you should encourage others to read it so they will see how clearly wrong it is. Those that want it burned or object to others reading it know that she offers some very strong arguments for a position they clearly do not want to be true.This book takes place probably around the 1950s. It is centered around the industrial sector of the U.S., the only government that has not become a People's State. The main character in this book is Dagny Taggart. She is a no-nonsense VP of Operations for the largest railroad in the world. She is intelligent and is solely driven to keeping her RR as the best.The times are dim and getting dimmer. In the beginning the country is in a recession of sorts and it is up to Taggart and others like her to save the country. There are two problems that are preventing her from doing this. One, the government seeks more and more control when it should be stepping away. Second, the men of industry are disappearing one by one just when they are critically needed. No one knows where they go off to.In the sense of a novel this is a good one. It is suspenseful and intriguing. Everyone can identify with the characters in this book. Most of the antagonists have been left rather shallow. That is on purpose. They are supposed to represent certain elements of society. This book can get dry at times. One man has a 60 page speech that can seem a little preachy at times but is wholly necessary within the context of the novel.Ayn Rand is perhaps the best known and widest read philosopher of the 20th century. If you have any interest in philosophy or economics then this is a must read. Don't fear her teachings. An open mind is a dangerous thing to some people.The most important thing to remember is not to take everything you read here as dogma.

A History Of The Arab Peoples -,"Chronicles the history of Arab civilization, looking at the beauty of the great mosques, the importance attached to education, the achievements of Arab science, the role of women, internal conflicts, and the Palestinian question","['Albert Hourani', 'Professor Albert Hourani']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kYq5AAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=kYq5AAAAIAAJ&q=A+History+Of+The+Arab+Peoples+-&dq=A+History+Of+The+Arab+Peoples+-&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Belknap Press,1991,http://books.google.com/books?id=kYq5AAAAIAAJ&dq=A+History+Of+The+Arab+Peoples+-&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Arab countries'],6.0,B000O0FGYQ,,A3NCKDPCAUOD4T,nto62,99/128,3.0,1006041600,Trying.................,"I finish most books in a week. Even the most punishing efforts I can conclude within a fortnight. Hourani's History of the Arab Peoples took me two months. This extended duration was not caused by any inability to fully understand it's content, but for the simple fact that I continually avoided picking it up.The unconscionable tragedy of September 11th inspired me to select this book from my shelf, purchased long before, to learn something more of the lands and events from which the terrorists sprung. History of the Arab Peoples is, in actuality, two books. The first half of the work deals not so much with the Arab peoples, but with the institution of Islam. Arab Christians and Jews receive short shrift as do any major historical event by Western reckoning. You will find scant reference of the Crusades, of Jerusalem, of colonial strife. Instead, we learn not what the Arab Peoples did, but the boundary of Islam within which they did it. Truly, the first 250+ pages would be better entitled A History of Islam.The latter half of the book consists mainly of the 19th century forward and it is here that Hourani finally uncouples, to whatever extent possible, the Arab peoples from Islam. Though he pays scant attention to events and prefers mainly to discuss socio-economic factors, the book manages to vault from mind numbing to something passably interesting.All things considered, I didn't enjoy this book. Still, my disappointment stems not from what the book is, but rather from what the book is not. It is not a History of the Arab Peoples - a true history would predate Muhammad - but an in depth tour of Islam followed closely by a treatise on modern-day Arabic society. Do not read this book if a narrative Arabic history is what you seek.",1

Countdown to Crisis: The Coming Nuclear Showdown with Iran,,,,,,,,,,1400053684,,A222LQEPE7O7BV,John G. Hilliard,99/126,5.0,1119139200,A Persian Carpet Of Lies,"It seems that the current non fiction environment lends its self to high drama works that, regardless of subject manner, all lead in the direction that the issue covered in the book is the most import of issue to be dealt with over the next so many years. This author also has a history of putting out books that seem to have a rather close relationship to the conservative issue of the day. So given this was my bias coming into this book you would think I would have nothing but negative comments, I assumed the same. The fact is the book is an enjoyable and interesting read. The author details out the growing issue that another Middle Eastern country is working to gain a nuclear weapon and what it might mean to us.As much as it might pain me to say this, I agree with many of the authors claims. There is no other country today that has so openly and brazenly supported terror in the Middle East. Iran is a country that is working to gain more influence in the Middle East with hopes of becoming the leader of a Soviet Union style dictatorship over the Middle East to bring back the glory of the great Persian empire of the past. The leaders of the country are pursing a goal of the total destruction of Israel and a subjugation of the rest of us. The book talks abut the many missed opportunities and missteps that have lead us to this point and gives the reasons why we are going to be dealing with them in an adversarial relationship for many years to come.Overall I really enjoyed the book. All over hype and drama aside, the author details out a threat to us as Americans if for no other reason then Iran is a country focused on objectives that a detrimental to our own and they happen to be in the most sensitive location on the planet today. I had to put aside my bias toward the author and in doing so I came away the better.",0
Middlesex [Unabridged Audiobook],"Spanning eight decades and chronicling the wild ride of a Greek-American family through the vicissitudes of the twentieth century, Jeffrey Eugenides’ witty, exuberant novel on one level tells a traditional story about three generations of a fantastic, absurd, lovable immigrant family -- blessed and cursed with generous doses of tragedy and high comedy. But there’s a provocative twist. Cal, the narrator -- also Callie -- is a hermaphrodite. And the explanation for this takes us spooling back in time, through a breathtaking review of the twentieth century, to 1922, when the Turks sacked Smyrna and Callie’s grandparents fled for their lives. Back to a tiny village in Asia Minor where two lovers, and one rare genetic mutation, set our narrator’s life in motion. Middlesex is a grand, utterly original fable of crossed bloodlines, the intricacies of gender, and the deep, untidy promptings of desire. It’s a brilliant exploration of divided people, divided families, divided cities and nations -- the connected halves that make up ourselves and our world.",['Jeffrey Eugenides'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rUHHbYhlIxYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=rUHHbYhlIxYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Middlesex+%5BUnabridged+Audiobook%5D&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Vintage Canada,2011-07-18,http://books.google.com/books?id=rUHHbYhlIxYC&dq=Middlesex+%5BUnabridged+Audiobook%5D&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],353.0,B000TKO3EA,,A37PV5GMP2ILJC,Amanda Richards,99/125,4.0,1182211200,Both a place and a gender,"This is a BIG book, and a little difficult to get through unless you can negotiate with your family for some quiet time.Basically, it chronicles the formative years of Cal Stephanides, beginning with the grandparents, Lefty and Desdemona, who were really-too-close for siblings, and who fled Greece as their village burned around them.

Franzen is a really smart, maybe even brilliant, definitely talented guy. When I read an excerpt from this novel which appeared last spring in The New Yorker as a short story, I thought it was one of the most profound and beautiful things I'd ever read. I expected the novel to be a contemporary Anna Karenina. Instead I got characters so flat, they seemed headed for a vacation on Gilligan's Island: the harping, mindless, chirpy mother; the hot blond chick wearing tight blue jeans who doesn't enjoy sex with her husband -- how could that be? -- because, as it turns out, she's a lesbian; the henpecked husband and his pathologically manipulative wife, blah blah blah. (Yeah, this novel is not &quot;epic&quot; enough to include even one mature female character.)Each of the main characters have their own subplots and I felt as if Franzen used the plots to flee exploration of character, and romp, instead, in irrelevance. One of the characters is this hip, professor-guy who's disaffected (or something)and doesn't know what to do with his life. He gets fired for having an affair with a student. (By the way -- such a shocking surprise -- the student is a sex/drug crazed maniac who preys on her teacher. Not the other way around. How original. Franzen's gone and reversed the stereotype. How did he ever think up that strategy?) So Franzen sends this down and out ex-professor character off on a wacky-hijinx-never-stop tour of Lithuania that seems to have nothing to do with who the character is or what he's facing. For me, the most boring section of the novel.When I finally got to the section I had loved as a story in the New Yorker, it flew right by and I had to recall its shape from memory. I think that's because Franzen smushed it into the midst of so much shlock involving a highly dramatic bisexual love triangle. Again, I didn't think the lesbian route (at least his totally un-profound rendition of it) goes toward the heart of who the Denise character is. My sense is that Franzen used the story line to flee Denise. Another thing -- The pacing and the shape of the novel as a whole are totally flat. Every single moment in the novel is weighted equally. It's just a string of episodes, with no breathers, no peaks, no valleys. Practically every sentence is an episode.The good stuff: The Alfred character is real, absorbing, interesting, poignant. Likewise the details about the railroad line where Alfred works. Also, if you like Jackie Collins (as I do when I'm in the mood), this book provides exactly that kind of entertainment. And if you're a prep school guy, you can pretend that your brain is being enriched as you read this 700-something page tome. And how do I describe the profound &quot;subtext&quot; of this book? Franzen bashes you over the head with it in the first chapter of the book, then periodically bashes you over the head again every time the word &quot;correction&quot; comes up (every 75 pages or so.) If it's that frigging easy to bash readers over the head with your &quot;subtext&quot; maybe you should just write it up as a five paragraph essay, and then if you want to write a novel, you can devote yourself honestly to character development and a thing called &quot;story&quot;, which is what a novel is supposed to be.",1
Confessions of an Economic Hitman,"Shocking Bestseller: The original version of this astonishing tell-all book spent 73 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, has sold more than 1.25 million copies, and has been translated into 32 languages. New Revelations: Featuring 15 explosive new chapters, this expanded edition of Perkins's classic bestseller brings the story of economic hit men (EHMs) up to date and, chillingly, home to the US. Over 40 percent of the book is new, including chapters identifying today's EHMs and a detailed chronology extensively documenting EHM activity since the first edition was published in 2004. Former economic hit man John Perkins shares new details about the ways he and others cheated countries around the globe out of trillions of dollars. Then he reveals how the deadly EHM cancer he helped create has spread far more widely and deeply than ever in the US and everywhere else—to become the dominant system of business, government, and society today. Finally, he gives an insider view of what we each can do to change it. Economic hit men are the shock troops of what Perkins calls the corporatocracy, a vast network of corporations, banks, colluding governments, and the rich and powerful people tied to them. If the EHMs can't maintain the corrupt status quo through nonviolent coercion, the jackal assassins swoop in. The heart of this book is a completely new section, over 100 pages long, that exposes the fact that all the EHM and jackal tools—false economics, false promises, threats, bribes, extortion, debt, deception, coups, assassinations, unbridled military power—are used around the world today exponentially more than during the era Perkins exposed over a decade ago. The material in this new section ranges from the Seychelles, Honduras, Ecuador, and Libya to Turkey, Western Europe, Vietnam, China, and, in perhaps the most unexpected and sinister development, the United States, where the new EHMs—bankers, lobbyists, corporate executives, and others—“con governments and the public into submitting to policies that make the rich richer and the poor poorer.” But as dark as the story gets, this reformed EHM also provides hope. Perkins offers a detailed list of specific actions each of us can take to transform what he calls a failing Death Economy into a Life Economy that provides sustainable abundance for all.",['John Perkins'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=p2vgCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=p2vgCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Confessions+of+an+Economic+Hitman&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Berrett-Koehler Publishers,2016-02-09,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=p2vgCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],2.0,B0009JKV7E,,A2JIAJ6EM08F0J,Lisa Robilio,99/120,2.0,1117756800,"OMG - blah, blah, blah","As a Democrat and liberal, and someone who decries US aggression and World Bank interventionism and all things Machiavelli, you would think this book was written entirely for me. I could not have been more wrong and more disappointed.I am embarrassed for John Perkins. I caught myself reading over passages again as I looked for some basis for his ""EHM"" title, or something to which he needed to confess that was worth the reading. I found myself gagging as he bemoaned his horrible childhood years with loving parents. I was crying out laughing when ""Jesus"" appears before him. Seriosly, I'm not making this up about his real life experiences. Our saviour comes to him, but not as our favorite white Anglo-Saxon type. Long before television and film made the shift to challenging this white man notion of God images, John Perkins is traveling in the third world and somehow imagines the media-molded perfect protest visit from a dark-skinned Jesus of the LDC variety. I am ashamed that my hard fought beliefs and values are sullied by this man's psychotic literary episodes. Who cares if Jesus is white, black or somewhere in between. But, there is no way I believe the author's account. Not because I was there, or because I know things like this do or do not happen, but because as a learned person and voracious reader, I know by reading that this story is completely untrue.If you get choked up over or tend to lament the agony and torment of cloistered, peaceful days in good schools, then this book is for you. About halfway through, or earlier, you realize that Perkins keeps on and on about these impressive, troubled years. You get the odd sense that it may be something chemical going on rather than his environment. I found his sexy secret agent friend to be just another curious manifestation of his Jesus creation.John Perkins is no hit man. His confessions are narcissistic and parochial all the while they pretend to be selflessly derived and cosmopolitan. His book is a sham. He is a sham. I am surprised that Amazon puts five star reviews at the top when I read down to so many repudiations of this book. It's very strange to find a work whose main thrust aligns so directly with my own positions while I find the narrator and protagonist to be so objectionable, and the throughline to be so fanciful and lacking in credibility. I would suggest calling this fiction instead of non-fiction. Unfortunately, as a literary work, its shortcomings are even greater.",0
Emotional Alchemy : How the Mind Can Heal the Heart,"Alchemists sought to transform lead into gold. In the same way, says Tara Bennett-Goleman, we all have the natural ability to turn our moments of confusion or emotional pain into insightful clarity. Emotional Alchemy maps the mind and shows how, according to recent advances in cognitive therapy, most of what troubles us falls into ten basic emotional patterns, including fear of abandonment, social exclusion (the feeling we don't belong), and vulnerability (the feeling that some catastrophe will occur). Through the simple practice of mindfulness taught in this book, we can free ourselves of such patterns and replace them with empathy for ourselves and others, as well as the freedom to be more creative and alive. You'll find the very latest research in neuroscience--including the neurological ""magic quarter second,"" during which it is possible for a thought to be ""caught"" before it turns into an emotional reaction. And you'll discover the fascinating parallels of this science with the wisdom of ancient Buddhism--for Buddhists knew centuries ago that we can end our self-destructive habits. This remarkable book also teaches the practice of mindfulness, an awareness that lets us see things as they truly are without distortion or judgment, giving the most insightful explanation of how mindfulness can change not only our lives, but the very structure of our brains. Here is a beautifully rendered work full of Buddhist wisdom and stories of how people have used mindfulness to conquer their self-defeating habits. The result is a whole new way of approaching our relationships, work, and internal lives.",['Tara Bennett-Goleman'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sXwwZWYhlLAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=sXwwZWYhlLAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Emotional+Alchemy+:+How+the+Mind+Can+Heal+the+Heart&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Harmony,2002-04-23,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sXwwZWYhlLAC&source=gbs_api,"['Body, Mind & Spirit']",8.0,B00021GLQO,,A3F7RHVPZ3I75,"Bill Butler ""Bill Butler""",99/119,5.0,980553600,A Worthy Attempt!!! And a New Beginning!! Buy it.,"This is a beautiful book. And by a beautiful human being. But we have to see where we are going. The author has, intentionally or unintentionally, created a new therapy. It is called Emotional Alchemy. Emotional Alchemy begins with Insight Meditation. Vipassana. The author then combines Insight Meditation beautifully with Schematic Therapy. She lists ten &quot;schemas&quot; for people with deep emotional problems. This book can be a Godsend. But the author is creating a new therapy. Does it work? I went to the website listed by her in the back of the book. They have 16 &quot;schemas&quot; listed there. As opposed to her 10. I took the long test there and scored 55% on &quot;Entitlement&quot;. Tara Bennett-Goleman suggests that one concentrates on the largest &quot;shema&quot; at once. Like Jack Kornfield, she believes that meditation can not cure mental illness. We have certain parts of our brains which will simply deny access no matter what. Even until we die. The wonderful revalations that come through this book is that she simply tells you where she is going to and where she has come from. This is entirely ignored by well-meaning new-age gurus such as Kornfield and Levine. They give out meditations in their books which more or less proclaim themselves as Buddhas! Tara Bennett-Goleman does no such thing. Her works are based on cognitive therapy, neuroscience, and insight meditation. With a foreward by the Dalai Lama, this is a pivotal work toward helping those withemotional problems. After seven years of homelessness, I still fall into the &quot;schema&quot; of Entitlement. You will also spot the schemas of Deprivation (emotional), Subjagation, Unloveability, ans so on. She is really postulating a theory in this book. Certain parts of the brain can not be accessed without something deeper than meditation. I appauld her efforts. Especially since she is not trying to merge Western Psychology with Buddhism as the authors that I mentioned are trying to do.But Insight Meditaion co-joined with Schematic Therapy will simply need more work. I think she may do it. But not in this book. I shall wait. Both the book and the author are real gems. Buy the book and get ready for a &quot;seperate&quot; Buddhist Therapy. God bless you.",1

I thought the concept was interesting, but I found the characters uninteresting, the dialogue ridiculous, and the pacing extremely slow. Or maybe I was just blinded by my hatred of Kirk Cameron. Whatever. At any rate, my boyfriend of the time loaned me the novel so I could see if it was any better than the movie.The book does correct several things I had issues with in the movie. That does not, however, excuse what an incredibly terrible piece of writing this is. I read more challenging novels in the third grade. If you can handle Nancy Drew, you should be ready for this novel. The character development is practically non-existant. Characters seem willing to change their entire world-view over remarkably silly things, and with relatively little internal struggle. And (as was mentioned in a previous review) the margins are ridiculously large (one assumes in an effort to make the book seem longer).I'm not going to get into the theology - other than to say that I'm catholic, and I personally do not believe in a lot of things mentioned here. But live and let live I say (even if the book's authors disagree with me). What I couldn't stand was the incredibly disrespectful tone the book took towards other religions. I found the Republicanism offensive as well - because Chrisitian is not synonimous with Republican, believe it or not.It wasn't persuasive or accessible enough to be a good piece of religious propaganda, and the writing was too poor for Sci-fi. Therefore I have to rate this as one of the worst books I've read.",1

Every verse dealing with the question of the role of women, slaves and homosexuals has been analyzed. I have taught New Testament at the college level for many years and learned a great deal from his approach.

In Huxley's darkly satiric yet chillingly prescient imagining of a ""utopian"" future, humans are genetically designed and pharmaceutically anesthetized to passively serve a ruling order. A powerful work of speculative fiction that has enthralled and terrified readers for generations, it remains remarkably relevant to this day as both a warning to be heeded and as a thought-provoking yet satisfying entertainment. This deluxe edition also includes the nonfiction work ""Brave New World Revisited,"" ""a thought-jabbing, terrifying book"" (Chicago Tribune), first published in 1958. It is a fascinating essay in which Huxley compares the modern-day world with his prophetic fantasy envisioned in Brave New World.

Everything Is Illuminated : A Novel,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER. Jonathan Safran Foer's debut—""a funny, moving...deeply felt novel about the dangers of confronting the past and the redemption that comes with laughing at it, even when that seems all but impossible."" (Time) With only a yellowing photograph in hand, a young man—also named Jonathan Safran Foer—sets out to find the woman who might or might not have saved his grandfather from the Nazis. Accompanied by an old man haunted by memories of the war, an amorous dog named Sammy Davis, Junior, Junior, and the unforgettable Alex, a young Ukrainian translator who speaks in a sublimely butchered English, Jonathan is led on a quixotic journey over a devastated landscape and into an unexpected past. As their adventure unfolds, Jonathan imagines the history of his grandfather’s village, conjuring a magical fable of startling symmetries that unite generations across time. As his search moves back in time, the fantastical history moves forward, until reality collides with fiction in a heart-stopping scene of extraordinary power. “Imagine a novel as verbally cunning as A Clockwork Orange, as harrowing as The Painted Bird, as exuberant and twee as Candide, and you have Everything Is Illuminated . . . Read it, and you'll feel altered, chastened—seared in the fire of something new.” — Washington Post “A rambunctious tour de force of inventive and intelligent storytelling . . . Foer can place his reader’s hand on the heart of human experience, the transcendent beauty of human connections. Read, you can feel the life beating.” — Philadelphia Inquirer",['Jonathan Safran Foer'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uU3bxcl70CIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=uU3bxcl70CIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Everything+Is+Illuminated+:+A+Novel&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,HarperCollins,2013-09-03,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uU3bxcl70CIC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],221.0,B00029ZWRU,,AJ9W09EUQPAKE,Sirin,99/116,2.0,1132531200,Storytelling doesn't have to shout,"Somewhere, buried in Everything is Illuminated is a poignant, moving, original story about a man searching for the woman who saved his Grandfather from the Nazis. Aiding him in his search is the most endearing character in the novel, Alex, who writes English by always searching for a thesaurus term to replace the plain original word - resulting in a highly entertaining brand of comically prolix English. This device is the best narration technique in the novel (although not, as many critics in the blurb claim, a linguistic achievement on a par with Burgess in A Clockwork Orange).The rest of the novel, however, is taken up with an aggressive array of flashy modern narrative devices - magic realism, hysterical realism, Jewish confession etc., all of which blast the reader with great 'look at me' demonstrations of the writer's virtuosity, but lack any sense of pacing, rhythm, balance and poise.The principal gripe I have with modern novels such as this, is that in such a competitive, overcrowded market, young writers feel pressured to burst out with something dazzling and innovative, often invoking a range of literary techniques (as Foer does) without really understanding how they can be used most effectively. If the New York publishing scene was less preoccupied with hyping up flashy new bestsellers, and let talented young writers develop slowly, modern novels might have a chance to display some of the quiet literary inspiration that is the hallmark of past masterpieces.",1

This book is packed with dates and facts about Kerry's 4 month service in Vietnam. The stories depicted in this book are strikingly different than the press releases and speeches given by Kerry during his campaign and throughout his political career.Here is a snip from Kerry's speech.""I remember Christmas of 1968 sitting on a gunboat in Cambodia. I remember what it was like to be shot at by the Vietnamese and Khmer Rouge and Cambodians, and have the president of the United States telling the American people that I was not there; the troops were not in Cambodia. I have that memory which is seared--seared--in me."" ---John KerrySince Kerry came back from Vietnam he has been repeating this story. He even mentioned it on the floor of the Senate in 1986. From what we can tell this story is a complete fabrication. To start with. Throughout this speech Kerry was implying that President Nixon directly changed policy to place swift boats into Cambodia. In reality Nixon was not the president in December 1968. So Nixon would not be able to order Kerry anywhere. Kerry was stationed at Coastal Division 13 in Cat Lo. Coastal Division 13 about 55 miles from Cambodia. At least three of the five crewmen on Kerry's boat, Bill Zaldonis, Steven Hatch, and Steve Gardner, deny that they or their boat were ever in Cambodia and all of Kerry's chain of command know his claim to be a flat out lie. (I could list them but I'd rather you get the book)This book is a must read if you want to know the truth about the Kerry campaign and its spin. His associations with 527 groups like moveon.org, Joint Victory Campaign 2004 and America Coming Together dwarf the financing that the Swift Vets for Truth have. (not to mention Fahrenheit 911)Its amazing that multi million dollar news agencies like the New York Times and Washington post are not willing to hold Kerry up to any objective reporting.It takes patriots like John O'Neill and the Swift Vets for Truth with very little cash to expose Kerry for what he is.Get this book.Support the troops.Lenny from Brooklyn, New York",1

"Why We Believe What We Believe: Uncovering Our Biological Need for Meaning, Spirituality, and Truth","WHY DO YOU BELIEVE THE THINGS YOU BELIEVE? Do you remember events differently from how they really happened? Where do your superstitions come from? How do morals evolve? Why are some people religious and others nonreligious? Everyone has thoughts and questions like these, and now Andrew Newberg and Mark Waldman expose, for the first time, how our complex views emerge from the neural activities of the brain. Bridging science, psychology, and religion, they demonstrate, in simple terminology, how the brain perceives reality and transforms it into an extraordinary range of personal, ethical, and creative premises that we use to build meaning, value, spirituality, and truth into our lives. When you come to understand this remarkable process, it will change forever the way you look at the world and yourself. Supported by groundbreaking research, including brain scans of people as they pray, meditate, and even speak in tongues, Newberg and Waldman propose a new model for how deep convictions emerge and influence our lives. You will even glimpse how the mind of an atheist works when contemplating God. Using personal stories, moral paradoxes, and optical illusions, the authors demonstrate how our brains construct our fondest assumptions about reality, offering recommendations for exercising your most important ""muscle"" in order to develop a more life-affirming, flexible range of attitudes. You'll discover how to: Recognize when your beliefs are altered by othersGuard against mental traps and prejudicial thinkingDistinguish between destructive and constructive beliefsCultivate spiritual and ethical ideals Ultimately, we must always return to our beliefs. From the ordinary to the extraordinary, they give meaning to the mysteries of life, providing us with our individual uniqueness and the ability to fill our lives with joy. Most important, though, they give us inspiration and hope, beacons to guide us through the light and dark corners of the soul.","['Andrew Newberg', 'Mark Robert Waldman']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iM1iFdvzyQMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=iM1iFdvzyQMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Why+We+Believe+What+We+Believe:+Uncovering+Our+Biological+Need+for+Meaning,+Spirituality,+and+Truth&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Simon and Schuster,2006-09-12,"http://books.google.com/books?id=iM1iFdvzyQMC&dq=Why+We+Believe+What+We+Believe:+Uncovering+Our+Biological+Need+for+Meaning,+Spirituality,+and+Truth&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Science'],7.0,B000N2HBU2,,A3FCLOKYEQFFWX,"Richard L. Deem ""Rich Deem""",99/113,4.0,1158710400,"Well-written and compelling, although with obvious biases","Andrew Newberg, professor of Radiology and Psychiatry, has written (along with Mark Robert Waldman) a sequel to his book, Why God Won't Go Away. The new book has strengths and weaknesses, but, should be of some interest to those who have an interest in spiritual matters and human behavior. The book is primarily written to address the question of how the brain works so that we arrive at what we believe to be true. The authors write from a spiritual perspective, but take numerous jabs at Christians and Christianity throughout the book. In contrast, New Age and Far Eastern religions seem to receive little or no criticism (co-author, Mr. Waldman seems to be into New Age type spirituality), and are actually endorsed. Likewise, atheists may not be entirely comfortable with the content, since it clearly challenges their cherished belief that that have no beliefs.Even with this viewpoint bias, the first two parts of the book (""How the brain makes our reality"" and ""Childhood development and morality"") are nothing less than fascinating. The topics are broad, so a lot of details are not included (especially supporting studies), although doing so would have increased the length considerably. Even so, I would have preferred more details and citations and a little of the controversy, which must be present in such a complex field. One gets the distinct impression that the results are not quite as neat and tidy as presented, and one wonders if studies that do not support the authors' premises are omitted as a form of viewpoint bias or just to save space.A particularly interesting chapter entitle, ""Ordinary Criminals Like You and Me,"" presents numerous experiments (many of which would be considered unethical today) that demonstrate that the vast majority of individuals will do extremely immoral acts, given the right conditions. For example, if enough people (planted experimental confederates) go along with a lie, test subjects will do likewise. In another study, participants ""electrocuted"" a ""student"" who was a ""poor learner."" Studies simulating prison conditions showed that the ""officers"" (experimental subjects) routinely mistreated the ""prisoners"" (also experimental subjects). In other experiments, subjects would usually act in selfish ways, rather than take the moral high ground. Newberg suggests that barring interception by our frontal lobes of our brain, all our actions would be immoral and selfish.The book's third section, spiritual beliefs and the brain, presents Newberg's latest (and earlier) functional brain scan results on religious people. Previously, Newberg had studied the brain activity of Buddhists practicing meditation and Franciscan nuns practicing ""centering prayer,"" a Roman Catholic method of meditating deeply on a specific biblical passage or concept. These results had shown similar patterns of brain activity for those meditating on ""becoming one with the universe"" or ""inner peace"" (Buddhists) and those meditating on God or the Bible. Both groups showed increased activity in the frontal lobes (primarily the prefrontal cortex), which represents the ""attention area"" and decreased activity in the parietal lobes (the ""orientation area""). Each group interpreted their experience on the basis of their beliefs (e.g., inner peace for the Buddhists or God's presence for the nuns). In this book, Newberg added a third group - Pentecostal Christians who ""speak in tongues."" When analyzed, the brain scans showed increased activity in the thalamus (as in Buddhists and nuns). Speaking in tongues also resulted in high activity in the temporal lobes (involved in making emotions) and in the midbrain (probably resulting from the activities of speech and dance). Like Buddhists and nuns, Pentecostals represent a small percentage of the American population (probably only about 1% of Americans claim to speak in tongues). Newberg presented one case (not exactly a scientific sampling) of a spiritual atheist. Like the Buddhists, he practiced meditation, and presented with a brain scan similar to the Buddhists and nuns (though the actual scans were not shown in the book).Also noteworthy was the finding of asymmetric thalamic activity in the Buddhists, nuns, Pentecostals, and even the one ""spiritual"" atheist, which is not found in the vast majority of people. The question arises whether these people are born with this asymmetry, resulting in the ability to play these mind games or whether the continual practice of the games themselves lead to the asymmetry. None of Newberg's studies were able to address these questions. An even more fundamental question concerns the rest of us, who lack the asymmetry, but still have religious beliefs. Maybe none of these studies really tell us anything about the kind of religious belief that most of us exhibit, since all the groups chosen for study represent extremely small minorities.In conclusion, the book is well-written and compelling, although the obvious biases of the writers will probably annoy most Christian readers. The topic is complex and experimental design is difficult at best. Future studies will likely shed more light on this subject.",1

On the surface, I have a good deal in common with Julie Powell. We are close in age and background, similar in work history, and both enjoy good food, good drinks, cursing and leaving the cleaning to someone else.After reading this book, if someone were to tell me I reminded them of Julie Powell, I would commit hari-kari. She is terribly unpleasant, self-absorbed and repellant. All of the characteristics with which I could identify are completely reduced to rubble in her hands. I find myself never wanting to hear or use the F-word ever again, and even I was repulsed by her disgusting apartment. I had to skip most of the passage involving maggots lest I lose my lunch. All the tales of sticky cat hair, brackish flooded fixtures and rotting floors didn't help either. I read most of the book with that look on my face people have when something nearby stinks.I assume she was attempting humor and exaggerating many of her misadventures and personality flaws, but the end result is that I loathe her as a fellow human being and wish ill upon her. Her heartless exposure of her friends' and family's personal lives is inexcusable (and dull) and her husband appears to be a combination saint/fool for putting up with her. Powell hates the project, hates her job, dislikes her husband (she mentions her frequent desire to beat his head with sharp rocks. I mean really! Eric! Run for your life!), disdains her friends, scorns her mother, disrespects Julia Child and admires only her cats and her brother.In its relentlessly bleak tone and insistence on examining the lives of detestable characters, this book reminds me ofA Confederacy of Dunces. Another supreme waste of time and positive energy.I think the lesson to be learned here is that a blogger does not an author make. The publishing industry needs to be really careful about offering book deals to just any successful blog author. Any fool with an internet connection can create a blog, after all. That doesn't mean they are worthy of anyone else's time or attention.",1
Skinny Dip,"Chaz Perrone might be the only marine scientist in the world who doesn’t know which way the Gulf Stream runs. He might also be the only one who went into biology just to make a killing, and now he’s found a way–doctoring water samples so that a ruthless agribusiness tycoon can continue illegally dumping fertilizer into the endangered Everglades. When Chaz suspects that his wife, Joey, has figured out his scam, he pushes her overboard from a cruise liner into the night-dark Atlantic. Unfortunately for Chaz, his wife doesn’t die in the fall. Clinging blindly to a bale of Jamaican pot, Joey Perrone is plucked from the ocean by former cop and current loner Mick Stranahan. Instead of rushing to the police and reporting her husband’s crime, Joey decides to stay dead and (with Mick’s help) screw with Chaz until he screws himself. As Joey haunts and taunts her homicidal husband, as Chaz’s cold-blooded cohorts in pollution grow uneasy about his ineptitude and increasingly erratic behavior, as Mick Stranahan discovers that six failed marriages and years of island solitude haven’t killed the reckless romantic in him, we’re taken on a hilarious, full-throttle, pure Hiaasen ride through the warped politics and mayhem of the human environment, and the human heart.

Carl Hiaasen's satire and dark humor do wonders for crime fiction. He turns out the most extraordinarily eccentric characters: the stripper sister-in-law; a quirky environmentalist nephew; the has-been writer neighbor; evil scoundrels who are beyond redemption; Tool, a hulking but kinda lovable brute, who is the villain's heavy; a trashy mistress; and resilient victims who give as good as they get...or better! Set in South Florida, Hiaasen highlights the area's nuttiness and some of the weird folks who inhabit that corner of our country. Not one character could be considered ""normal"" in this novel, but behind strange facades beat good hearts.Joey Perrone, the almost-murdered wife of corrupt Charles ""Chaz"" Perrone, makes it back to shore after her husband tosses her overboard a cruise ship, far off Key West's coast. He must have underestimated Joey's talents. She's a former swim star. And thanks to a floating bale of marijuana and the assistance of Mick Stranahan, a burnt-by-love ex-cop, she doesn't sink. Oh no! Joey lives for pay-back.Chaz, an incompetent marine biologist, (he doesn't even know which direction the Gulf Stream flows in), has long been on the take from agribusiness tycoon Red Hammernut, (great name!), who's been dumping fertilizer into the endangered Everglades. He thinks that Joey has discovered that he's been exchanging clean-water samples for the actual tainted water that is the result of Hammernut's environmental pollution. But his wife doesn't have a clue about the scam.The lovely, curvaceous Joey recovers her strength, mental and physical, at the island home of her gallant rescuer Mike, who is the victim of six failed marriages. Instead of going to the police, however, she decides to play dead. She persuades Mike to help her mess with Chaz's mind while she figures out why he tried to kill her.This is a fast paced, fun, often hilarious read with wonderful characters...and humor galore, if you laugh at dark things and enjoy farce mixed with your suspense. I really enjoyed it.JANA",1
Jimmy Corrigan: The smartest kid on earth : souvenir book of views (Acme novelty library),,,,,,,,,,B0006E8UPW,,AL5OEDM8TPTKV,James Hiller,99/111,5.0,1053302400,Emotionally distant and affecting...,"I've never done this before. Buy a book. Can't stand it. Return it a few days later. Buy it back a few hours later. Fall in love with it. Such is my journey with Chris Ware's graphic book, &quot;Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth&quot;. Let me tell you first why I returned it, and what redeemed it.I came across this book after a brief EW mention of it, rating it very high. Intrigued, I purchased a copy, and attempted to delve into its layers. Instead of intrigue, I found frustration, mainly because I simply didn't know how to look at the book. I didn't know where my eyes were supposed to go, so many of the early pages were difficult to read. Plus, the characters constant and sudden lapses into their daydreams made for early confusion.So, I returned it, happy of my decision. And then, I attended a live version of &quot;This American Life&quot; that prominently featured the work of Ware. His artwork captivated me, enough to rebuy the book and try again. What I found was an entralling, captivating tale, multi-layered, and worth all the work to learn the language of his drawings.It's the story of Jimmy Corrigan, an everyman without much of a life at all, who is contacted by his long lost father for a Thanksgiving reunion. Jimmy agrees to attend, which leads him on a retrospective journey of his life and his family. The story is both moving and rich, full of layers upon layers. Once you learn Ware's language, and what he tries to communicate, the story begins to shine like a lighthouse beacon through the pages. I was surprised to find myself crying at certain parts of the book; my brain was telling me this is simply a comic story, but my heart was breaking along with the characters. That alone is impressive.Ware's drawings are incredible. He communicates so much through each drawing, you need to &quot;read&quot; this slowly, and internalize the story. Whereas you tend to want to skip the less important drawings, quite often they will give you the most information. This book is not one to read quickly, but enjoy, like a fine, fine wine.I look forward to more work from Chris Ware. His artist's eye is impressive, but his storytelling is even more so.",1
Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang,"In 1998, William Queen was a veteran law enforcement agent with a lifelong love of motorcycles and a lack of patience with paperwork. When a “confidential informant” made contact with his boss at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, offering to take an agent inside the San Fernando chapter of the Mongols (the scourge of Southern California, and one of the most dangerous gangs in America), Queen jumped at the chance, not realizing that he was kicking-starting the most extensive undercover operation inside an outlaw motorcycle gang in the history of American law enforcement. Nor did Queen suspect that he would penetrate the gang so successfully that he would become a fully “patched-in” member, eventually rising through their ranks to the office of treasurer, where he had unprecedented access to evidence of their criminal activity. After Queen spent twenty-eight months as “Billy St. John,” the bearded, beer-swilling, Harley-riding gang-banger, the truth of his identity became blurry, even to himself. During his initial “prospecting” phase, Queen was at the mercy of crank-fueled criminal psychopaths who sought to have him test his mettle and prove his fealty by any means necessary, from selling (and doing) drugs, to arms trafficking, stealing motorcycles, driving getaway cars, and, in one shocking instance, stitching up the face of a Mongol “ol’ lady” after a particularly brutal beating at the hands of her boyfriend. Yet despite the constant criminality of the gang, for whom planning cop killings and gang rapes were business as usual, Queen also came to see the genuine camaraderie they shared. When his lengthy undercover work totally isolated Queen from family, his friends, and ATF colleagues, the Mongols felt like the only family he had left. “I had no doubt these guys genuinely loved Billy St. John and would have laid down their lives for him. But they wouldn’t hesitate to murder Billy Queen.” From Queen’s first sleight of hand with a line of methamphetamine in front of him and a knife at his throat, to the fearsome face-off with their decades-old enemy, the Hell’s Angels (a brawl that left three bikers dead), to the heartbreaking scene of a father ostracized at Parents’ Night because his deranged-outlaw appearance precluded any interaction with regular citizens, Under and Alone is a breathless, adrenaline-charged read that puts you on the street with some of the most dangerous men in America and with the law enforcement agents who risk everything to bring them in.",['William Queen'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zfqvVuqSm-gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=zfqvVuqSm-gC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Under+and+Alone:+The+True+Story+of+the+Undercover+Agent+Who+Infiltrated+America%27s+Most+Violent+Outlaw+Motorcycle+Gang&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Random House,2005-04-05,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zfqvVuqSm-gC&source=gbs_api,['True Crime'],23.0,0345487524,7.59,A103YPVK70AGXR,Michael J.

It's a gossipy, amusing and no doubt mostly accurate piece of muck raking on the personal lives and character of the major players in the Bush clan.

And from the content of the reviews I'm going to be cynical and guess that the majority of them have not even read it (I smell the Heritage foundation and Christian coalition at work here). Sadly, this semi literate rabble seems to make up the majority of the political base for the current junta.As many reviewers have pointed out, most of this information is not terribly new. Is anyone really surprised that Kelly shows the current president as an intellectual dwarf that got where is by political graft and the largess of daddy's friends? Is anyone really shocked to discover that Mama Bush is a spiteful and domineering battle-axe. Is anyone surprised that George senior was referred to by Nixon as ""The kind of man you appoint to things"" (read: not fit for elective office)?Anyone who thinks that this book is ""vile"", ""trash"" and ""unfair"" definitely hasn't been on the receiving end of the Bushes vindictiveness.

Poirier,99/110,5.0,1080259200,A stimulating revival of Mary&#65533;s image,"In a previous book, (""She who is""), Elizabeth Johnson helped us gain some insight into the mystery of God seen from a feminist standpoint. She tried to emphasize the feminine in God. She focused on God as ""Wisdom Spirit"" which is perhaps the most abstract of our concepts of the Divine.In the present book, so to speak, she comes back down to earth by focusing on Mary, who was intimately linked to the Spirit and yet remains far more accessible to us humans. Mary can be named, and quite naturally be represented as a woman. She is a definitely more attractive, familiar and reassuring image than that of a spirit.The author goes, maybe with too much detail, into the historical and cultural contexts in which Mary spent her time on earth. She does that in order to show that Mary was a real woman, a real sister to the other women of this world. She rejects the usual image of Mary as the perfect icon because she finds it counterproductive. All the out-of-this-world privileges which are bestowed on her in the classical view, actually put her out of reach from other women. In the end, she has nothing left in common with the real women of this world.Elizabeth Johnson wants to convince that despite all that has been said, Mary remains within reach of her twenty first century sisters. That Mary was a very active, autonomous and responsible woman who can be and should be a real model for all the women of this world, because she actually was one of them. She lived and strived in a difficult male-oriented patriarchal society. She lived and acted in her own right, and not as someone who received her identity through a man from whom she should necessarily depend.This also holds true regarding the unique relationship that Mary enjoyed with the Divine. Elizabeth Johnson wants to demonstrate that Mary was not just a passive obedient tool in the hands of God, but an active, willing and determined participant in the history of God's self communication to humanity. When she was visited by the angel, she decided on her own to agree and to go along with God's project. And then, during all her life she remained consistent with this positive and responsible attitude.A lot of other interesting considerations are to be found all along this stimulating book, if the reader takes his or her time on the way.",1

Six Days of War: June 1967 and the Making of the Modern Middle East,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • The first comprehensive account of the epoch-making Six-Day War, from the author of Ally—now featuring a fiftieth-anniversary retrospective Though it lasted for only six tense days in June, the 1967 Arab-Israeli war never really ended. Every crisis that has ripped through this region in the ensuing decades, from the Yom Kippur War of 1973 to the ongoing intifada, is a direct consequence of those six days of fighting. Writing with a novelist’s command of narrative and a historian’s grasp of fact and motive, Michael B. Oren reconstructs both the lightning-fast action on the battlefields and the political shocks that electrified the world. Extraordinary personalities—Moshe Dayan and Gamal Abdul Nasser, Lyndon Johnson and Alexei Kosygin—rose and toppled from power as a result of this war; borders were redrawn; daring strategies brilliantly succeeded or disastrously failed in a matter of hours. And the balance of power changed—in the Middle East and in the world. A towering work of history and an enthralling human narrative, Six Days of War is the most important book on the Middle East conflict to appear in a generation. Praise for Six Days of War “Powerful . . . A highly readable, even gripping account of the 1967 conflict . . . [Oren] has woven a seamless narrative out of a staggering variety of diplomatic and military strands.”—The New York Times “With a remarkably assured style, Oren elucidates nearly every aspect of the conflict. . . . Oren’s [book] will remain the authoritative chronicle of the war. His achievement as a writer and a historian is awesome.”—The Atlantic Monthly “This is not only the best book so far written on the six-day war, it is likely to remain the best.”—The Washington Post Book World “Phenomenal . . . breathtaking history . . . a profoundly talented writer. . . . This book is not only one of the best books on this critical episode in Middle East history; it’s one of the best-written books I’ve read this year, in any genre.”—The Jerusalem Post “[In] Michael Oren’s richly detailed and lucid account, the familiar story is thrilling once again. . . . What makes this book important is the breadth and depth of the research.”—The New York Times Book Review “A first-rate new account of the conflict.”—The Washington Post “The definitive history of the Six-Day War . . . [Oren’s] narrative is precise but written with great literary flair. In no one else’s study is there more understanding or more surprise.”—Martin Peretz, Publisher, The New Republic “Compelling, perhaps even vital, reading.”—San Jose Mercury News",['Michael B.

Oren shows the complex issues that moved the Egypt and Israel into a deadly tragedy. Putting the Six-Day War into his vast Cold War context illuminates the impotence of the Superpowers, the incompetence of Egypt and Syria, and the dangerous gamble Israel took when launching its necessary strike.Oren gives us as many perspectives as he can; American, Russian, Israeli, Eqyptian, Jordanian, English participants all have their say. The brilliance of this book is not just Oren's gripping account of the war, but his making the reader understand the incredible pressure that Nasser, King Hussein, and Levi Eshkol were under. This book made me feel some sympathy for the Egyptians, poorly-led, sacrificed to Nasser's macho posturing and cronyism, to Cold war cant, and massive poverty.What is chilling about this book is that nearly forty years later, not much has changed, as Oren points out.Readers of Tom Clancy will find real people and real tragedy more gripping than fake heroics; no heros here, just survivors.",1

Dr. Riley-Smith's book is up to date while the previous work of Runciman (and others) is considered passe by the professional historian. Unfortunately, people with an axe to grind rarely are interested in the facts when their cherished preconceptions are in jeopardy.Dr. Riley-Smith's book covers not only the medieval Crusades but also other religious wars in the later historic times. He demonstrates the complex motivations of the major figures in these various conflicts and shows that their primary concern had been religious, not economic or imperialistic. There is no &quot;cover up&quot; of some of the darker aspects of the Crusades, but Riley-Smith has a better understanding of the 'sitz im leben' of the Medieval world than many previous writers on this subject. Dr. Riley Smith is careful not to judge people from another time by modern standards. He dispels a number of myths that men like Runciman have unfortunately perpetuated.This is an excellent review book for the general topic of religious wars since the Middle Ages.

The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER “We need a new idea of how to govern. The current system is broken. Law is supposed to be a framework for humans to make choices, not the replacement for free choice.” So notes Philip K. Howard in the new Afterword to his explosive manifesto The Death of Common Sense. Here Howard offers nothing less than a fresh, lucid, practical operating system for modern democracy. America is drowning—in law, lawsuits, and nearly endless red tape. Before acting or making a decision, we often abandon our best instincts. We pause, we worry, we equivocate, and then we divert our energy into trying to protect ourselves. Filled with one too many examples of bureaucratic overreach, The Death of Common Sense demonstrates how we—and our country—can at last get back on track.",['Philip K. Howard'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=M5CLDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=M5CLDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Death+of+Common+Sense:+How+Law+is+Suffocating+America&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Random House Trade Paperbacks,2011-05-03,http://books.google.com/books?id=M5CLDQAAQBAJ&dq=The+Death+of+Common+Sense:+How+Law+is+Suffocating+America&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Law'],6.0,0446672289,10.94,A40DKMJ53EXUD,"Charles G. Hardin, chardin@govreform.org",99/109,5.0,919814400,Law has replaced humanity and process supercedes reason.,"Philip Howard's insights help us understand why government appears arbitrary, almost never able to deal with real-life problems in a way which reflects an understanding of the situation. Peppered with pointed anecdotes about absurd regulatory inflexibility and the lack of the use of judgement, Howard's book reveals that we have concocted a system of regulation that ""goes too far while it does too little.""In the decades since WWII, specific legal mandates designed to keep government in check have proliferated. The result is not better government, but more and poorer government. In a free society, we are supposed to be free to do what we want unless it is prohibited. But highly detailed regulations proscribing exactly what to do turn us toward centralized uniformity, Howard says, where law has replaced humanity. Detailed rules and uniform procedures have nonuniform effects when applied to specific situations.Our old system of common law recognized the particular situation and invited the application of common sense. Common law evolved with the changing times and its truth was relative, Howard tells us, not absolute. But in this century statutes have largely replaced common law, and in recent decades regulations have come to dominate the legal landscape. Howard observes that the Interstate Highway System (still the nation's largest public works program) was authorized in 1956 with a 28-page statute. Now, we attempt to cover every situation explicitly. He cites one contract lawyer who received a proposed definition of the words and/or that was over three hundred words in length. (Let alone the more recent and prominent lawyer who parsed carefully over the definition of what the word &quot;is&quot; is.)Howard traces the growth of this regulatory ""rationalism"" from Max Weber - the German sociologist at the turn of the century who said that ""Bureaucracy develops the more perfectly, the more it is `dehumanized'"" - to Theodore Lowi - who in The End of Liberalism in 1979 saw greater regulatory specificity to be the antidote to special interest groups. But in truth, Howard shows us, the more precise we try to make the law, the more loopholes are created.Centralized rules have caused us to cast away our common sense. Furthermore, ""Coercion by government, the main fear of our founding fathers, is now its common attribute. But it was not imposed to advance some group's selfish purpose; we just thought it would work better this way. The idea of a rule detailing everything has had the effect of reversing the rule of law. We now have a government of laws against men.""The second section of Howard's book explains how the ritualization of bureaucratic process has brought us to the point where people argue, not about right and wrong, but about whether something was done the right way. He sees the agency as mainly a referee to the process, not a decision maker. He beautifully describes how the bureaucracy surges and falls, en masse, onto a decision. Even Sherlock Holmes wouldn't be able to identify an actual decision maker! The process decided.In this maze of centralized, detailed regulation - a system designed to discourage individual responsibility - many have lost sight of what government is supposed to be doing. Howard argues that process is a defensive device; the more procedures, the less government can do. The paradox is that we demand an activist government while also demanding elaborate procedural protections against government. ""The route to a public goal cannot be diverted through endless switchbacks of other public goals, for example, without losing sight of the original destination."" He tells us that responsibility, not process, is the key ingredient to action. If responsibility is shared widely, then like the extreme where property is shared widely, it is like there being no responsibility at all.Effective government, Howard suggests, is one which attracts the best people and gives them leadership responsibility. But we have created the opposite system, based on defensive formalisms, driving away good people who cannot abide the negativity of the process.The last section of Howard's book explores the ""rights revolution,"" where government has become ""like your rich uncle under your personal control"" and everyone now gets to be a part of a legally-mandated, discriminated-against minority. As rights weaken the lines of authority in our society, the walls of responsibility - such as how a teacher manages a classroom - have begun to crumble. We want government to solve social ills, but distrust it to do so. Congress has resolved this dilemma by using rights to transfer governmental powers to special interest groups. The result has not been bringing excluded groups into society, but rather has become the means of getting ahead in society. Howard makes the distinction that, ""The rights that are the foundation of this country are rights against law. In James Madison's words, the Constitution provides for `protection of individual rights against all government encroachments, particularly by the legislature.' Rights - freedom of speech, property rights, freedom of association - were to be the antidote against any new law that impinged on those freedoms.""In this way, Howard finds that we have confused power with freedom. These new legislative rights aren't rights at all, no matter how righteous they sound. ""They are blunt powers masquerading under the name of rights."" He says we need to consider how these new rights impinge on what others consider to be their own freedoms. The flip side of the coinage of the new rights regime is called coercion.Howard suggests that our loathing of government is not caused by its goals, but by its techniques. ""How law works, not what it aims to do, is what is driving us crazy."" Decision making must be transferred ""from words on a page to people on the spot.""His book brings us closer to a place where what is right and reasonable, not the parsing of legal language, dominates the discussion. His thoughts shine needed light on the path to common sense and responsibility in government.",1
The Glycemic-Load Diet: A powerful new program for losing weight and reversing insulin resistance,"A cardiologist's revolutionary weight-loss plan that allows dieters to enjoy good carbs while still losing weight The glycemic index has been the basis of many popular diets. But it doesn't take into account the serving sizes people actually eat and eliminates too many foods for dieters to stick with it. Now Dr. Robert Thompson's breakthrough program uses the glycemic load--the glycemic index adjusted for serving size--to take the GI a step forward. The glycemic load is a more accurate and effective tool in controlling weight and insulin resistance, allowing dieters to eat more foods while still burning fat, cutting cravings, and speeding up their metabolism.

All grains are given the thumbs down, with no mention of rolled oats and barley as low GL. Even more surprisingly, beans/lentils were not mentioned or promoted even though they have low glycemic loads and are healthy and filling.

Bowles, in this slyly subversive book, reverses that. The three Americans who start out on this largely pointless journey into the North African desert, hope the mere fact of movement will resolve their deep spiritual lethargy - or at least delay their having to face it. They imagine themselves sophisticated, wearing their cynicism as a talisman in a cultural landscape of troubling strangeness. But they are simply unaware. Faced with an elemental vastness that cares nothing for their conceits, they dis-integrate. Only one survives and she is so utterly changed - physically and in spirit - that she can no longer recognise herself, nor see a future for herself in the world she formally inhabited. Although the prime characters are fundamentally unpleasant - at least for most of the book - the lasting impression is of an eerie, spectral beauty. It is a quiet masterpiece; I know of few books that are more subtly teasing - that more wisely poke at our arrogance in imagining that we know anything.",0

As you read you discover the great advice, which clearly is directed at women, yet much of it holds true for guys too. I can see how the strategies would work. As a guy I don't want to see all our secrets given away.Among the many pieces of advice offered are have a life, overcome your own issues such as low self esteem, and learn to love yourself.Issues can be overcome. After all, if you don't love yourself enough then you are relying on a guy for validation. How can you persuade a guy how fabulous you are if you don't believe it yourself.That is not a permanent fix, at best its a dubious band aid. Guys know women with low self esteem are not good relationship material, so why do so many women say they have low self esteem. Go figure. The best thing is to be a self sufficient woman, be less available, have alternative plans. Give him the gift of missing you, if necessary. This creates mystery, which is a vital ingredient for developing a relationship. Less is more.Letting go of seeking perfection in a man is excellent advice. If a guy has 80% of the qualities you are looking for, you should bag him, tag him, and take him home. My sister once dated a guy, and said 'if he had a chipped front tooth he'd be perfect.' So even perfection is not all its cracked up to be.Develop an abundance mentality. Women search for 'the one'. There are many who fit the bill from a pool of billions to choose from. Let go of scarcity.I thought the advice on bringing up the subject of marriage was particularly good, avoiding the ultimatum. Another book I read mentions that women have to bring up this subject almost 70% of the time.The advice on date topics and questions is also excellent. There should be a rule about not talking about your job, the weather, and telling the story of your life like a history lesson, and conducting a date like a job interview. These are just routine, and guys get these types of conversations from their buddies. Excluding these topics forces you to be interesting. Talk about what excites you instead.Unlike other bestselling dating books, I can see how this book would work, and the more you apply the concepts the better they will work for you.Oh, and if you want to improve your ability to love yourself and others, I recommendSoul Love: Awakening Your Heart Centers (Roman, Sanaya)by Sanaya Roman, in which you use your imagination and work with your chakras. It literally is a heartwarming book. My number one recommend in this genre isWhy Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship.

When the Emperor Was Divine,"From the bestselling, award-winning author of The Buddha in the Attic, this commanding debut novel paints a portrait of the Japanese incarceration camps that is both a haunting evocation of a family in wartime and a resonant lesson for our times. On a sunny day in Berkeley, California, in 1942, a woman sees a sign in a post office window, returns to her home, and matter-of-factly begins to pack her family's possessions. Like thousands of other Japanese Americans they have been reclassified, virtually overnight, as enemy aliens and are about to be uprooted from their home and sent to a dusty incarceration camp in the Utah desert. In this lean and devastatingly evocative first novel, Julie Otsuka tells their story from five flawlessly realized points of view and conveys the exact emotional texture of their experience: the thin-walled barracks and barbed-wire fences, the omnipresent fear and loneliness, the unheralded feats of heroism. When the Emperor Was Divine is a work of enormous power that makes a shameful episode of our history as immediate as today's headlines.

If the Universe Is Teeming with Aliens ... WHERE IS EVERYBODY?: Fifty Solutions to the Fermi Paradox and the Problem of Extraterrestrial Life,"Given the fact that there are perhaps 400 billion stars in our Galaxy alone, and perhaps 400 billion galaxies in the Universe, it stands to reason that somewhere out there, in the 14-billion-year-old cosmos, there is or once was a civilization at least as advanced as our own. The sheer enormity of the numbers almost demands that we accept the truth of this hypothesis. Why, then, have we encountered no evidence, no messages, no artifacts of these extraterrestrials? In this second, significantly revised and expanded edition of his widely popular book, Webb discusses in detail the (for now!) 75 most cogent and intriguing solutions to Fermi's famous paradox: If the numbers strongly point to the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations, why have we found no evidence of them? Reviews from the first edition: ""Amidst the plethora of books that treat the possibility of extraterrestrial intelligence, this one by Webb ... is outstanding. ... Each solution is presented in a very logical, interesting, thorough manner with accompanying explanations and notes that the intelligent layperson can understand. Webb digs into the issues ... by considering a very broad set of in-depth solutions that he addresses through an interesting and challenging mode of presentation that stretches the mind. ... An excellent book for anyone who has ever asked ‘Are we alone?’."" (W. E. Howard III, Choice, March, 2003) ""Fifty ideas are presented ... that reveal a clearly reasoned examination of what is known as ‘The Fermi Paradox’. ... For anyone who enjoys a good detective story, or using their thinking faculties and stretching the imagination to the limits ... ‘Where is everybody’ will be enormously informative and entertaining. ... Read this book, and whatever your views are about life elsewhere in the Universe, your appreciation for how special life is here on Earth will be enhanced! A worthy addition to any personal library."" (Philip Bridle, BBC Radio, March, 2003) Since gaining a BSc in physics from the University of Bristol and a PhD in theoretical physics from the University of Manchester, Stephen Webb has worked in a variety of universities in the UK. He is a regular contributor to the Yearbook of Astronomy series and has published an undergraduate textbook on distance determination in astronomy and cosmology as well as several popular science books. His interest in the Fermi paradox combines lifelong interests in both science and science fiction.",['Stephen Webb'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QWKyrQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=QWKyrQEACAAJ&dq=If+the+Universe+Is+Teeming+with+Aliens+...+WHERE+IS+EVERYBODY%3F:+Fifty+Solutions+to+the+Fermi+Paradox+and+the+Problem+of+Extraterrestrial+Life&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Springer,2015-05-29,http://books.google.com/books?id=QWKyrQEACAAJ&dq=If+the+Universe+Is+Teeming+with+Aliens+...+WHERE+IS+EVERYBODY%3F:+Fifty+Solutions+to+the+Fermi+Paradox+and+the+Problem+of+Extraterrestrial+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Science'],2.0,B000FGGN1E,5.5,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,Dennis Littrell,99/109,5.0,1048723200,Examining their navels?,"This is the most up-to-date and thorough discussion of the Fermi Paradox that I have read. Stephen Webb examines all the popular solutions as well as some esoteric ones, giving us considerable background on each along with the benefit of his knowledge on a wide range of relevant subjects including microbiology, plate tectonics, evolution, intelligence, language, philosophy, as well as astronomy and cosmology. And then he gives his solution: we are alone.That was Fermi's solution of course, and it is a popular one; however I don't think that Webb comes anywhere near to making a convincing case; and at any rate he is somewhat equivocal about whether his answer applies to the entire universe or to just the galaxy. It is clear that his answer applies only to life as we know it, having a carbon based biochemistry and a cellular structure. My feeling is that intelligent life forms may evolve from some other chemical basis or even from some use of energy and matter we know nothing about.On pages 237 to 239 Webb presents his argument that we are the only extraterrestrial civilization (ETC) in the galaxy by a process of elimination, i.e., life must be on a planet within both a galactic habitable zone (GHZ) and a solar continuously habitable zone (CHZ) around the right kind of star; must avoid cosmic disasters like supernovae; must have the right kind of moon, Jupiter, and plate tectonics; must evolve beyond single cells; must develop tool use and language, etc. He ends up sifting out everything except us, and the only reason he doesn't sift us out is that he has set us aside since we actually exist!This is close to sophistry, perhaps, but it has been argued before. I might call it the Fallacy of Elimination by Unknown Probabilities about Matters that May or May Not Be Essential. Putting that aside, consider this: If we extrapolate from what we know (as opposed to any speculation) about the existence of life in just our own galaxy, we should expect on average--at the very least--one ETC per galaxy. Wow. Far from being alone, this suggests more than 100 billion other ETCs are out there, although we are not likely to ever communicate with them.One of the things this book demonstrates, as others have before (see especially, Peter D. Ward and Donald Brownlee's Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe [2000], which Webb acknowledges as influential), is that when you're dealing with so little concrete information in such a vastness, it is impossible to be entirely convincing one way or the other. The conclusion in Rare Earth, with which Webb concurs, is that life is common in the universe, but intelligent life is rare. I agree substantially with this, but my ""rare"" is perhaps larger than their ""rare.""Some of the familiar but crucial questions considered here were addressed in the excellent Extraterrestrials: Where Are They? (1995) edited by Ben Zuckerman and Michael H. Hart. For example, How long do ETCs exist before they go extinct? Is space travel enormously difficult and expensive or is it just very difficult? Do ETCs have a psychology similar enough to ours to make them want to communicate? How would they communicate, using what sort of medium?--even: would we recognize a communication from an ETC if we received one?The answer to these questions and many others is, we don't know. But it's fun to speculate; and in speculating at least we can eliminate many conceptual and logical errors that might crop up. Furthermore such speculations expand the mind and allow the imagination a greater range. In direct contrast to Webb I think there's only the smallest chance that we are alone. Amazing how people can come to such divergent conclusions from the same evidence!For such answers as, They are so advanced that they have no interest in communicating with us, and They are so into their own self-constructed pleasure-enhancing virtual existence that they care not to look outward, etc., Webb has a ready response. For such answers to solve the Fermi paradox, he says, they have to apply to every single ETC. Surely, he posits, not all ETCs would have such a psychology. But, by taking all such solutions and playing an elimination game similar to the one Webb plays on pages 237-239, we can reverse his conclusion and eliminate all existing ETCs as non-communicative for one reason or another, arriving at the grand conclusion that we are not alone and that there are indeed a whole bunch of ETCs out there.I wish I had the space to address some other Stephen Webb arguments that I think are faulty, but perhaps just one more will be suggestive. On page 229, while arguing that only humans have symbolic language, he relates an experiment in which a dolphin learns to operate an apparatus to release food. The dolphin is timed. Then the scientists close that dolphin off and release a second dolphin into the pool with the apparatus. The first dolphin can send signals to the second dolphin. The scientists then time how long it takes for the second dolphin to learn to work the apparatus. They discover that it takes the second dolphin on average just as long as it did the first. Webb writes: ""We can conclude from this that the first dolphin was unable to tell the second dolphin how the apparatus worked.""Well, maybe. But replace the dolphins with humans, and the reward of food with hundred dollar bills, and perhaps we might conclude that humans are also unable to communicate how the apparatus worked!Bottom line: for SETI enthusiasts and anyone interested in the prospect of extraterrestrial life, this is a book, despite its flaws, not to be missed.",1

I assume the translation of the sutras is the same while Shearer, who is a disciple of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, has updated his Introduction. The text is presented in a sky blue color that is easy on the eyes and does not distract from the meaning of the words. The design by Barbara Sturman is indeed very attractive while the small size of the book (4.75 by 6.25 by 0.75 inches) makes for easy portability.The translation itself takes up about one-third of the book while Shearer's commentary takes up most of the rest. The translation is strikingly original and interpretative. Patanjali's famous first line, which I recall most agreeably as &quot;Now, instruction in yoga&quot; (which I have from Ernest Egerton Wood's Practical Yoga, 1948) is presented as &quot;And now the teaching on yoga begins.&quot; B.K.S. Iyengar, in his Light on the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali (1993), which I highly recommend in addition to this book, has &quot;With prayers for divine blessings, now begins an exposition of the sacred art of yoga.&quot;Clearly the differences with this first line are mainly stylistic with Iyengar emphasizing a spiritual and religious tone while Wood's aim was to reflect Patanjali's succinct style, with Shearer looking for lucidity and an affinity with the modern English expression. But let's look at the second sutra. Shearer's &quot;Yoga is the settling of the mind into silence&quot; is very pretty, and when one realizes that &quot;silence&quot; to Shearer is akin to godliness (he quotes Meister Eckhart on page 24: &quot;Nothing in all creation is so like God as silence&quot;), it works in a symbolic sense as well. Professor Wood's &quot;Yoga is the control of the ideas in the mind&quot; places a very different emphasis. But in Shearer's understanding, the idea of &quot;control&quot; is inappropriate. He sees instead that &quot;Once pointed in the right direction, the mind will begin to settle down of its own accord. It needs no control or forcible restraint.&quot; (p. 68)From my experience (I began my practice of yoga in 1974) both of these ideas are correct; and indeed it is a synthesis of conscious control of the ideas of the mind along with a sense of falling away that leads to meditation and samadhi. It is a mistake to imagine that one makes no effort, since it is the very essence of yoga that one does indeed make an effort and uses technique in order to find liberation (rather than, say, faith or knowledge). Yoga is above all a practice and nothing in it can be fully appreciated without practice. But it is also a mistake to think that one can through force of will achieve samadhi. What is required is a controlled practice in which one leads the reluctant mind and body to a place of relaxed concentration in which meditation is allowed to take place.But let's now look at how Iyengar translates this famous second aphorism: &quot;Yoga is the cessation of movements in the consciousness.&quot; He adds, &quot;This vital sutra contains the definition of yoga: the control or restraint of the movement of consciousness, leading to their complete cessation.&quot; (Light on the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, p. 46)While I think Shearer's translation is very much worthwhile, I am less enthusiastic about his interpretation. He devotes the last part of his Introduction to the famous &quot;siddhas&quot; (psychic powers). He attempts to justify and explain them in terms of quantum mechanics, averring that &quot;the subatomic universe...reveals a reality that is every bit as strange as Patanjali's.&quot; (p. 79) He even compares the superfluidity of helium near absolute zero to what is possible in the &quot;least excited state of awareness&quot; (i.e., the self in samadhi). This sophistic suggestion, which has largely been discredited, at least in the scientific community, relies on the false belief that the human mind (a macro object all the way down to the molecular level) can in some way operate on the quantum level. This is &quot;New Age&quot; babble of the most annoying sort and does not in any way explain the so-called psychic powers. Anyone who has practiced yoga long enough and has become adept at meditation has experienced these psychic powers, but realizes that they are phenomena of the mind and have nothing to do with ordinary consciousness or ordinary experience. They are--and this is why they are valuable and why Patanjali mentions them--signposts on the way to samadhi. When one experiences a siddha, it is an indication that one has stilled the ordinary mind and is making progress. I don't think Shearer really understands this.I could also take exception to his interpretation of some of the limbs of Patanjali's yoga, or express my appreciation of some of his insights. For example, I think his translation of shaucha (sauca) as &quot;simplicity&quot; instead of the usual &quot;cleanliness&quot; or &quot;purity&quot; is very agreeable. On the other hand, I could disagree with his interpretation of brahmacharya as something more than celibacy. I think brahmacharya means exactly that, celibacy. Or I could find his idea that pratyahara is akin to William Blake's &quot;closing the doors of perception&quot; (p. 68) interesting and worth adding to the regular meaning of &quot;withdrawal of the senses.&quot; But these fine distinctions would be beside the point. Note well that the sole purpose of Patanjali's yoga is liberation from the pair of opposites (pleasure and pain) that dominate our lives. The word &quot;samadhi&quot; (the goal of yoga) means both the highest level of meditation and something akin to the Buddhist &quot;satori,&quot; or enlightenment. All of yoga is a means to this end.For anyone beginning their yoga practice this book can help, but it should be understood that reading this or any other translation and interpretation of Patanjali's yoga sutras is only the beginning and is actually worthless without the concomitant practice of yoga.",0

"Cadillac Desert: The American West and Its Disappearing Water, Revised Edition","""The definitive work on the West's water crisis."" --Newsweek The story of the American West is the story of a relentless quest for a precious resource: water. It is a tale of rivers diverted and dammed, of political corruption and intrigue, of billion-dollar battles over water rights, of ecological and economic disaster. In his landmark book, Cadillac Desert, Marc Reisner writes of the earliest settlers, lured by the promise of paradise, and of the ruthless tactics employed by Los Angeles politicians and business interests to ensure the city's growth. He documents the bitter rivalry between two government giants, the Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, in the competition to transform the West. Based on more than a decade of research, Cadillac Desert is a stunning expose and a dramatic, intriguing history of the creation of an Eden--an Eden that may only be a mirage. This edition includes a new postscript by Lawrie Mott, a former staff scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, that updates Western water issues over the last two decades, including the long-term impact of climate change and how the region can prepare for the future.",['Marc Reisner'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=g7NDDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=g7NDDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Cadillac+Desert:+The+American+West+and+Its+Disappearing+Water,+Revised+Edition&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Penguin,1993-06-01,"http://books.google.com/books?id=g7NDDwAAQBAJ&dq=Cadillac+Desert:+The+American+West+and+Its+Disappearing+Water,+Revised+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Technology & Engineering'],19.0,0140178244,12.24,A25VWZTZR8GKMN,J.

Well, I discovered that the story of moving people and water into the West where humans really have no natural right living is quite entertaining. Reisner is the perfect storyteller and he permeates this real drama of pure will, deceit, graft, engineering prowess and the pork barrel with a subtle sarcastic wit I could read all day. He makes a real effort to keep his personal views out of the picture and rely on interviews and statistics. Even though it seems that he likely sees most large water projects as foolhardy and boondoggles he presents both sides - for example highlighting how one of the massive Comubia River dams had the unexpected value of helping us win WWII through power generation. I read this for a book club and the four of us (all California natives) used it as a springboard for literally hours of conversation. This should be required reading for anyone who claims to be an informed citizen living in the American West.There is also an excellent PBS companion 4 video series of the same name which I found available at my library (or sold through Amazon.com packaged with Chinatown) which I would HIGHLY recommend. It adds a lot thorough interviews, footage of a dam failing, and beautiful scenery that lets you appreciate the natural beauty at stake when considering these large water projects.",1

I keep seeing that word, ""disappointment,"" all throughout these reviews, and I don't think that's simply coincidence. These are my personal, major complaints in no particular order:1) *Shift of plot type*I got hooked on these books because they were a cool, supernatural combination of the whodunit, detective, and action genres. Don't get me wrong, Anita's love/sex-life has always been part of the stories, but it wasn't ever really the primary plotline. Now it is, and since I don't dig soft-core erotica nor romance novels, I don't care for it.2) *Apparent metamorphosis of major characters*When I was reading passages involving Dolph or Richard, I couldn't imagine why they're now such different characters. People go through difficult, sometimes traumatizing times in life, but for pete's sake, these guys are so different from the way they were in the previous books that their names ought to be changed!3) *The ardeur*I'm sick of it, sick of it, sick of it. That's about as concisely as I can put it.4) *Long hair on men*Okay, Hamilton, so you like long hair on guys. So do I -- on the right guy, of course. But get over it! I'm weary of reading endless descriptions of some man's long, flowing, beautiful, cascading, lustrous, rippling, flaxen, luxurious, blah blah blah hair. Oh, and lets not forget how traumatizing it is for his friends when a man cuts off his long hair!!5) * ""So much meat"" *Might there possibly be any other phrase to describe a human being who's been ripped to shreds? &lt;reaching for thesaurus...> Seriously, I should've kept track of how many times that particular phrase was abused... er, used.6) *Lack of editing*Way too many typos, grammatical errors, blatant overuse of some phrases and words (e.g. #5 on my list). Need I say more? Although, like another reviewer said, this is less the fault of Hamilton than of her editor/agent/publishing house/whatever.There's more, but I think I'll leave it at that.Back when my friend first got me hooked on this series, I practically salivated with anticipation during the weeks before each new book was released. Since _ Narcissus in Chains_ was a letdown to me, I was eager to see if the next book would be an improvement. How sad that it wasn't. I would say I won't bother to read the next book in the series, but I know my lack of willpower won't let that happen. I'm sure I'll read it anyway, if only out of pure, morbid curiosity.",0
The Quest for Cosmic Justice,"This book is about the great moral issues underlying many of the headline-making political controversies of our times. It is not a comforting book but a book about disturbing and dangerous trends. The Quest for Cosmic Justice shows how confused conceptions of justice end up promoting injustice, how confused conceptions of equality end up promoting inequality, and how the tyranny of social visions prevents many people from confronting the actual consequences of their own beliefs and policies. Those consequences include the steady and dangerous erosion of fundamental principles of freedom -- amounting to a quiet repeal of the American revolution. The Quest for Cosmic Justice is the summation of a lifetime of study and thought about where we as a society are headed -- and why we need to change course before we do irretrievable damage.",['Thomas Sowell'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5eU2KN9ChnEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=5eU2KN9ChnEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Quest+for+Cosmic+Justice&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Simon and Schuster,2001-06-30,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5eU2KN9ChnEC&source=gbs_api,['Political Science'],4.0,B00009V2NL,,,,99/106,5.0,946166400,And Satan Said: &quot;Ye Will Be As Gods&quot;,"As I read this book, the thoughts of arrogance, condescension, and hubris came to mind - not towards the author - but towards the subjects of his discussion. Certainly one cannot fault the social engineers and institutional &quot;tinkerers&quot; for their intentions. However, intentions are not the measure of success - results are.The policies of the &quot;anointed&quot; have become gospel, not subject to debate or empirical verification. In essence, anyone who disagrees with them or offers another approach is necessarily opposed to the intentions of those holding the true &quot;gospel&quot; of social harmony, prosperity, and peace.But this substitute for evidence and effectiveness has failed the most important element - those who are the intended beneficiaries of the &quot;anointed&quot; policies. The efforts to &quot;equalize&quot; and pursue &quot;cosmic justice&quot; not only have few success stories - but rather there is an abundance of proof to show that their policies are counter-productive and even harmful.But never mind the petty details! We're merely interested in doing the right thing, having the right motives, having our hearts in the right place, etc. Consequences be damned! We know what works best! The conquest for social justice will not be deterred by such things as uncooperative human beings, lack of success, or the Rule of Law.This book is an excellent follow-up to Sowell's &quot;Vision of the Anointed&quot; as it drives home the point that those who embrace visions of cosmic ideals are embarking upon an endeavor requiring super-human skill. And their pursuit in spite of this fact does good for no one - not the least of which are those who they claim to want to help. In pursuit of their cosmic ideals, the visionaries have become impervious to the reality that frustrates their plans.It is past time to cease the game of demonizing those that disagree with the ideas and policies of the &quot;anointed.&quot; It's time for the &quot;gods of social justice&quot; to admit their humanity and potential for failure - to re-open discussion so that the business of genuinely helping people can take place.For those interested in an outside observer's perspective (i.e. outside the circle of the &quot;anointed&quot;) on the practicality and efficacy of the modern vision of social justice, this book is a must read. Those who are part of the &quot;anointed&quot; or supporters of the same are going to find Sowell's assessment disturbing. Nevertheless, a symbolic gesture from an &quot;anointed&quot; would be his willingness to abandon his self-righteousness by reading this book with an open heart and mind.",1

Great Tales Of Terror And The Supernatural,,,,,,,,,,B000KKBMHU,,AUY7L0SJNUM95,"C. Sahu ""Cathy Sahu""",99/105,5.0,914889600,Indispensible for Ghost Story Lovers,"I've read all the stories in this book at least 3 times. Most of the times I skip around, but twice I've read straight through -- the stories are so consistently good, and, though wide ranging, complement each other so well. These are NOT horror stories. Horror (to me, at least) implies not only more explicit violence, but also an attitude that reality is, at core, physically and morally chaotic. &quot;Dark Descent&quot; is a horror anthology -- &quot;Great Tales&quot; is for the most part (although &quot;The Great God Pan&quot; and H.P. Lovecraft's 2 stories provide some exception) more old-fashioned &quot;ghost stories,&quot; and what mystery genre critics would categorize as &quot;English cozy&quot;: pleasant characters, warm surroundings introduced all the better to scare you with later on. The evil is seen through a hole in the curtain, so to speak, and never engulfs. The first group of stories (&quot;Tale of Terror&quot;) are not exactly supernatural, but extremely suspenseful, with wonderful denouements. Poe's &quot;The Facts in the Strange Case of M. Valdemar&quot; is wonderfully horrible - a dying man is hypnotised to keep him alive (it turns out to be a mistake, of course). &quot;Suspicion&quot; by Dorothy Sayers is NOT a murder mystery, but a perfectly built-up tale of suspense. I've read it a dozen times and the pace of the story still catches me. &quot;Home for Christmas,&quot; in which a nice doctor kills his bossy wife before leaving on vacation, would make a great Hitchcock movie. &quot;Moonlight Sonata&quot; is the short but shocking story of a man who stays overnight at a friend's house and awakens to an unpleasant visitor (not a ghost, but worse). Despite the emphasis on surprise endings, all of these stories have such great style and atmosphere that they are often, if anything, better the 2nd or 3rd time around. The second group, &quot;Tales of the Supernatural,&quot; have all the qualities mentioned above but are more wide ranging in terms of imaginativeness. My Man M.R. James fits right in here, of course, and 2 of his best tales - &quot;Oh, Whistle and I'll Come to You, My Lad&quot; and &quot;Casting the Runes&quot; - are featured. Also Guy de Maupassant (&quot;Was It a Dream?&quot;, in which a young lover spends the night mourning the death of his mistress in a cemetery, is fabulous). Also Rudyard Kipling; E.F. Benson; Algernon Blackwood (&quot;Ancient Sorceries&quot; features a mild-mannered Englishman oddly drawn to a small French village with a history of witchcraft); and such great titles as &quot;The Screaming Skull&quot; and &quot;The Haunters and the Haunted or The House and the Brain&quot; which, despite the campy names, will leave you far from laughing. There are stories in this section, also, that would better be categorized as fantasy (&quot;The Celestial Omnibus&quot; and &quot;Adam and Eve and Pinch-me&quot;). I liked them a lot even though I don't usually read fantasy. The majority are SCARY, though, and all are well-written by any standard (Henry James gives us &quot;Sir Edmund Orme&quot; and Ernest Hemingway tells of &quot;The Killers&quot;). If you like a more modern style, more explicit sex and violence, less atmosphere and more cut-to-the-chase, this book probably isn't for you. But if you like good, old-fashioned, solid, subtle, clever writing, with lots of atmosphere as well as great plotting (and you like to be scared), then this is a must-have.",1

I'm now fininshing up another of her works, &quot;Legacy From The Stars&quot;, and have two more titles of hers laying in wait on my bedside table. I express this as measure of the impact of that her books have had upon me. I found them all to be rather remarkable. If you're the debunker-skeptic type let me save you some time. Move on. There's nothing for you here. If, however, you're of the more open minded inclination and not threatened by possibilities and ideas outside the purview of &quot;the norm&quot; then take note. Despite the fact that modern day hypnosis has been used as an effective technique for nigh on a century, it is only now being accorded the interest and professional credibility that it has long since deserved. I'm happy to say, Mrs. Cannon's regressive hypnotherapy work pushes the envelope of what is &quot;the norm&quot; even further, to its limits and beyond. In a truly fascinating series of regressions with various hypnotherapy subjects she explores some of the most fundamental questions of our existence. Do you want to know how the universe was formed, are we alone, where we came from, who we are, who created us, where we're going, what it's all about, and how aliens, extra-dimensional entities, reincarnation, the afterlife, and the soul all neatly fit into it? You'll find answers in here. Whether you find them to be true will remain for you to decide. And as well it should be. Trust your gut and intuition here and give you left-brain anal-lyzer a rest. As one who has seen a UFO on more than one occasion, and has had any number of paranormal experiences (experiences which science will eventually prove be to nothing more than a product of previously undiscovered physics), I find the material contained within &quot;Keepers Of The Garden&quot; and her other books to be accurate, honest in its attempt to reveal the truth, and possessing the quality of all forward-looking Good. Chances are, as you read this book you'll find yourself saying such things as, &quot;Of course, that's so obvious. Why didn't I ever think of it?&quot; Have you ever had the experience of reading something and feeling like it was something you had forgotten but were now only just remembering again? Well, if you like that feeling then read &quot;Keepers of The Garden&quot; and revel in it.",1
The Kybalion: a Study of the Hermetic Philosophy of Ancient Egypt and Greece,"This vintage book was published in 1912 by the Yogi Publication Society. Purporting to be based on ancient Hermeticism, it presents seven all-encompassing principles: Mentalism, Correspondence, Vibration, Polarity, Rhythm, Cause and Effect, and Gender. A fascinating volume that claims to appear in one's life only when its teachings are required, “The Kybalion” constitutes a must-have for those with an interest in Hermeticism. Contents include: “The Hermetic Philosophy”, “The Seven Hermetic Principles”, “Mental Transmutation”, “The All The Mental Universe”, “The Divine Paradox”, “''The All'' in All”, “Planes of Correspondence”, “Vibration”, “Polarity”, “Rhythm”, “Causation”, “Gender”, “Mental Gender”, and “Hermetic Axioms”.

Kybalion states that universe is mind-like in nature; quantum physics states that the universe is composed out of intelligent energy. The rest of the book describes how to manifest anything with one's thoughts - the process of manifestation, and it reminds me of the book ""Dimensional Structure of Consciousness"" by Samuel Avery.The most important part of this book - other than pointing out these principles is that they are UNIVERSAL - they allways work, they express throughout nature and if you use them and apply the consciously, you can create whatever you can possibly desire in your life. You will know then that there is a law and that it works with mathematical precision, and that you can ALWAYS count on it.The moment you grasp this truth, you will never ever again wish or hope for something to happen, you will know that you have the power to create it and you will be certain of it.

Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural,"When this longtime Modern Library favorite--filled with fifty-two stories of heart-stopping suspense--was first published in 1944, one of its biggest fans was critic Edmund Wilson, who in The New Yorker applauded what he termed a sudden revival of the appetite for tales of horror. Represented in the anthology are such distinguished spell weavers as Edgar Allen Poe (""The Black Cat""), Wilkie Collins (""A Terribly Strange Bed""), Henry James (""Sir Edmund Orme""), Guy de Maupassant (""Was It a Dream?""), O. Henry (""The Furnished Room""), Rudyard Kipling (""They""), and H.G. Wells (""Pollock and the Porroh Man""). Included as well are such modern masters as Algernon Blackwood (""Ancient Sorceries""), Walter de la Mare (""Out of the Deep""), E.M. Forster (""The Celestial Omnibus""), Isak Dinesen (""The Sailor-Boys Tale""), H.P. Lovecraft (""The Dunwich Horror""), Dorothy L. Sayers (""Suspicion""), and Ernest Hemingway (""The Killers""). ""There is not a story in this collection that does not have the breath of life, achieve the full suspension of disbelief that is so particularly important in [this] type of fiction,"" wrote the Saturday Review.

Sahu ""Cathy Sahu""",99/105,5.0,914889600,Indispensible for Ghost Story Lovers,"I've read all the stories in this book at least 3 times. Most of the times I skip around, but twice I've read straight through -- the stories are so consistently good, and, though wide ranging, complement each other so well. These are NOT horror stories. Horror (to me, at least) implies not only more explicit violence, but also an attitude that reality is, at core, physically and morally chaotic. &quot;Dark Descent&quot; is a horror anthology -- &quot;Great Tales&quot; is for the most part (although &quot;The Great God Pan&quot; and H.P. Lovecraft's 2 stories provide some exception) more old-fashioned &quot;ghost stories,&quot; and what mystery genre critics would categorize as &quot;English cozy&quot;: pleasant characters, warm surroundings introduced all the better to scare you with later on. The evil is seen through a hole in the curtain, so to speak, and never engulfs. The first group of stories (&quot;Tale of Terror&quot;) are not exactly supernatural, but extremely suspenseful, with wonderful denouements. Poe's &quot;The Facts in the Strange Case of M. Valdemar&quot; is wonderfully horrible - a dying man is hypnotised to keep him alive (it turns out to be a mistake, of course). &quot;Suspicion&quot; by Dorothy Sayers is NOT a murder mystery, but a perfectly built-up tale of suspense. I've read it a dozen times and the pace of the story still catches me. &quot;Home for Christmas,&quot; in which a nice doctor kills his bossy wife before leaving on vacation, would make a great Hitchcock movie. &quot;Moonlight Sonata&quot; is the short but shocking story of a man who stays overnight at a friend's house and awakens to an unpleasant visitor (not a ghost, but worse). Despite the emphasis on surprise endings, all of these stories have such great style and atmosphere that they are often, if anything, better the 2nd or 3rd time around. The second group, &quot;Tales of the Supernatural,&quot; have all the qualities mentioned above but are more wide ranging in terms of imaginativeness. My Man M.R. James fits right in here, of course, and 2 of his best tales - &quot;Oh, Whistle and I'll Come to You, My Lad&quot; and &quot;Casting the Runes&quot; - are featured. Also Guy de Maupassant (&quot;Was It a Dream?&quot;, in which a young lover spends the night mourning the death of his mistress in a cemetery, is fabulous). Also Rudyard Kipling; E.F. Benson; Algernon Blackwood (&quot;Ancient Sorceries&quot; features a mild-mannered Englishman oddly drawn to a small French village with a history of witchcraft); and such great titles as &quot;The Screaming Skull&quot; and &quot;The Haunters and the Haunted or The House and the Brain&quot; which, despite the campy names, will leave you far from laughing. There are stories in this section, also, that would better be categorized as fantasy (&quot;The Celestial Omnibus&quot; and &quot;Adam and Eve and Pinch-me&quot;). I liked them a lot even though I don't usually read fantasy. The majority are SCARY, though, and all are well-written by any standard (Henry James gives us &quot;Sir Edmund Orme&quot; and Ernest Hemingway tells of &quot;The Killers&quot;). If you like a more modern style, more explicit sex and violence, less atmosphere and more cut-to-the-chase, this book probably isn't for you. But if you like good, old-fashioned, solid, subtle, clever writing, with lots of atmosphere as well as great plotting (and you like to be scared), then this is a must-have.",1

Invisible Man (Great Books of the 20th Century),"Invisible Man is a milestone in American literature, a book that has continued to engage readers since its appearance in 1952. A first novel by an unknown writer, it remained on the bestseller list for sixteen weeks, won the National Book Award for fiction, and established Ralph Ellison as one of the key writers of the century. The nameless narrator of the novel describes growing up in a black community in the South, attending a Negro college from which he is expelled, moving to New York and becoming the chief spokesman of the Harlem branch of ""the Brotherhood"", and retreating amid violence and confusion to the basement lair of the Invisible Man he imagines himself to be.

How wrong I was--this makes my short list of the greatest stories ever written. Ellison creates a vivid and shocking picture of America and society's subversion of individual identity in search of something larger. He said soon after the book was published that &quot;Invisible Man&quot; was not just about the black experience in America, it was an account of every person's &quot;invisibility&quot; in a world that tells us how to think of each other. The African-American protagonist is merely a vehicle for Ellison's much broader social commentary. Complex, heart-wrenching, deeply moving and of course beautifully written, this book is a must-read for anyone who thinks they have a grip on the American experience.",0

But I have to admit that I ended up skipping a lot of the material after reading the first 100 pages or so because it gets somewhat repetitious. So this indeed makes a good reference book, say, when you hear someone mention a ""Long Put Condor"" and wonder what it is. Or if you forget what market conditions (volatile, neutral, etc) would be required for a Bear Call Spread to work well. Also, I do appreciate Guy's organization of strategies by Risk/Reward, Direction, Volatility, etc. That makes it easy to get a short list of strategies given your own trading style and the market conditions.What I found missing that I wish was there is information like how far from Option Expiry should this strategy be placed, what is an optimum range of IV for the underlying stock for each type of strategy, when should the strategy be repaired or exited? How do you repair it, or leg in or out successfully?Also, I still do not understand what the little charts mean at the end of each strategy. I understand that they represent some kind of profile for each of the greeks, but there's no scale or indicators on the axes, nor can I find an explanation of what the dotted, dashed and solid lines mean. Maybe it's just me, since I've only been trading options for about a year now. If you're an experienced option trader, you'll probably know what they mean.",1

But you are laughing and smiling with polite respect towards the old master.I picked up ""A Man without a Country"" at the Coop and opened at random, and read this paragraph:""In case you haven't noticed, as the result of a shamelessly rigged election in Florida, in which thousands of African Americans were arbitrarily disenfranchised, we now present ourselves to the rest of the world as proud, grinning, jut-jawed, pitiless war-lovers with appallingly powerful weaponry- who stand unopposed.""He continues on in this vein, and draws parallels between the current worldview of America and the way the world viewed Germany as the Nazis rose to power. He has the clarity and honesty to refer to the characters running the Bush administration as psychopaths.Wow! I take it all back. Perhaps, in ""Timequake"" he was burdened with the artifact of a failed novel, but wanted to make something out of it, colored it with his unique perspective but ended up with a softer version of his usual fare. It felt a little lazy, like Vonnegut imitating Vonnegut.But here, freed from the artifice of fiction, we get classic Vonnegut. In fact, more than a return to form, but better than ever. This book finds him clever and witty, but also very angry and indignant, and righteously so. I have the same concerns and emotions but lack the ability to formulate it and express it in words so beautifully. So it's refreshing to read Vonnegut, and it's inspiring to know that he is not the doddering old professor but a wise old lion with still plenty of bite left.I won't try to tell you it's all great, that there are none of the soft, self-indulgent moments that detract from his later novels, but there is plenty of greatness on display.

Love, love, love. I do have one complaint, though. With 140 recipes, it's going to take me forever to try them all! Especially since I just want to keep making my favorites over and over again.Anyway, I could gush for hours about how great the recipes themselves are. [The Richer Than Fort Knox Cake was a huge hit at my husband's workplace. Everyone was shocked that 1) it wasn't from a bakery, and 2) it was 100% vegan. And I always love showing people that you don't deprive yourself of good things by making vegan choices.] But before I get carried away, I'd like to point how how much I love the organization of the book. Each recipe is divided into simple steps, and recipes are subdivided into sections--like the cake, the frosting, the garnish, etc. Also, Ms. Dieterly includes serving info, prep and baking time, and nutritional information, and also notes whether the recipe freezes well. And for those with wheat allergies, all of the wheat-free recipes are specifically marked as such.She has recipes for the following dessert categories: cookies and brownies; cakes and quick breads; Boston cream pies; pies and tarts; cheesecakes; puddings; donuts and candy; beverages and smoothies; and frostings, toppings, and crusts. Sadly, there are no vegan ice cream recipes. But I'll be so busy eating brownies and cheesecakes and donuts, I won't have time for ice cream anyway!The ingredients she uses should be familiar to most vegan cooks, and I don't have any trouble finding them. However, if you're new to vegan baking or live in an area where it's difficult to find, for example, silken tofu, then the author provides an introduction to the vegan ingredients you'll need, as well as a list of mail-order companies from which you can purchase the necessary ingredients. And if you're still searching, a quick Google search can reveal numerous places on-line to purchase vegan foodstuffs.Finally, I'd just like to comment on the writing style. I really enjoy reading the author's recipe descriptions and other comments. She's clear and informative, but also sounds like a friend who's hanging out in your kitchen while you're baking.All in all, this is a great cookbook. Buy it and amaze your friends with your delicious--and compassionate--desserts.",1
"Vietnam, a history","""A landmark work...The most complete account to date of the Vietnam tragedy."" -The Washington Post Book World This monumental narrative clarifies, analyzes, and demystifies the tragic ordeal of the Vietnam war.

Great tales of terror and the supernatural,"When this longtime Modern Library favorite--filled with fifty-two stories of heart-stopping suspense--was first published in 1944, one of its biggest fans was critic Edmund Wilson, who in The New Yorker applauded what he termed a sudden revival of the appetite for tales of horror. Represented in the anthology are such distinguished spell weavers as Edgar Allen Poe (""The Black Cat""), Wilkie Collins (""A Terribly Strange Bed""), Henry James (""Sir Edmund Orme""), Guy de Maupassant (""Was It a Dream?""), O. Henry (""The Furnished Room""), Rudyard Kipling (""They""), and H.G. Wells (""Pollock and the Porroh Man""). Included as well are such modern masters as Algernon Blackwood (""Ancient Sorceries""), Walter de la Mare (""Out of the Deep""), E.M. Forster (""The Celestial Omnibus""), Isak Dinesen (""The Sailor-Boys Tale""), H.P. Lovecraft (""The Dunwich Horror""), Dorothy L. Sayers (""Suspicion""), and Ernest Hemingway (""The Killers""). ""There is not a story in this collection that does not have the breath of life, achieve the full suspension of disbelief that is so particularly important in [this] type of fiction,"" wrote the Saturday Review.

Sahu ""Cathy Sahu""",99/105,5.0,914889600,Indispensible for Ghost Story Lovers,"I've read all the stories in this book at least 3 times. Most of the times I skip around, but twice I've read straight through -- the stories are so consistently good, and, though wide ranging, complement each other so well. These are NOT horror stories. Horror (to me, at least) implies not only more explicit violence, but also an attitude that reality is, at core, physically and morally chaotic. &quot;Dark Descent&quot; is a horror anthology -- &quot;Great Tales&quot; is for the most part (although &quot;The Great God Pan&quot; and H.P. Lovecraft's 2 stories provide some exception) more old-fashioned &quot;ghost stories,&quot; and what mystery genre critics would categorize as &quot;English cozy&quot;: pleasant characters, warm surroundings introduced all the better to scare you with later on. The evil is seen through a hole in the curtain, so to speak, and never engulfs. The first group of stories (&quot;Tale of Terror&quot;) are not exactly supernatural, but extremely suspenseful, with wonderful denouements. Poe's &quot;The Facts in the Strange Case of M. Valdemar&quot; is wonderfully horrible - a dying man is hypnotised to keep him alive (it turns out to be a mistake, of course). &quot;Suspicion&quot; by Dorothy Sayers is NOT a murder mystery, but a perfectly built-up tale of suspense. I've read it a dozen times and the pace of the story still catches me. &quot;Home for Christmas,&quot; in which a nice doctor kills his bossy wife before leaving on vacation, would make a great Hitchcock movie. &quot;Moonlight Sonata&quot; is the short but shocking story of a man who stays overnight at a friend's house and awakens to an unpleasant visitor (not a ghost, but worse). Despite the emphasis on surprise endings, all of these stories have such great style and atmosphere that they are often, if anything, better the 2nd or 3rd time around. The second group, &quot;Tales of the Supernatural,&quot; have all the qualities mentioned above but are more wide ranging in terms of imaginativeness. My Man M.R. James fits right in here, of course, and 2 of his best tales - &quot;Oh, Whistle and I'll Come to You, My Lad&quot; and &quot;Casting the Runes&quot; - are featured. Also Guy de Maupassant (&quot;Was It a Dream?&quot;, in which a young lover spends the night mourning the death of his mistress in a cemetery, is fabulous). Also Rudyard Kipling; E.F. Benson; Algernon Blackwood (&quot;Ancient Sorceries&quot; features a mild-mannered Englishman oddly drawn to a small French village with a history of witchcraft); and such great titles as &quot;The Screaming Skull&quot; and &quot;The Haunters and the Haunted or The House and the Brain&quot; which, despite the campy names, will leave you far from laughing. There are stories in this section, also, that would better be categorized as fantasy (&quot;The Celestial Omnibus&quot; and &quot;Adam and Eve and Pinch-me&quot;). I liked them a lot even though I don't usually read fantasy. The majority are SCARY, though, and all are well-written by any standard (Henry James gives us &quot;Sir Edmund Orme&quot; and Ernest Hemingway tells of &quot;The Killers&quot;). If you like a more modern style, more explicit sex and violence, less atmosphere and more cut-to-the-chase, this book probably isn't for you. But if you like good, old-fashioned, solid, subtle, clever writing, with lots of atmosphere as well as great plotting (and you like to be scared), then this is a must-have.",1

It would normally take me about three days with pretty substantial reading time during those days. But there was just something about it, and I made time and read this one pretty much straight through. It is easily one of the most wonderful novels I have ever read.There is so much to like about it. There is sheer joy in reading Waugh's prose as small nuggets of humor and beauty are uncovered throughout. The characters are pretty over-the-top (done on purpose) which makes them entertaining, but the depth of the characters is the truly striking thing. It's usually between the lines, but these characters are changing dramatically throughout, and for the better. I think the theological discussion running throughout the novel is what really makes it rise to true greatness. Waugh's making a compelling argument for a moral universe, and he is revealing what God's grace may look like working in people's lives.Brideshead Revisited is true masterpiece that really cannot be missed by any lover of literature or by any person looking for some meaning out there. It's a joy in every sense of the word. This is one book I'm going to come back to.",1

Daar leert ze mensen kennen die een heel ander leven leiden en er ideeën op nahouden die haaks staan op die van haar.

Raw Meaty Bones Promote Health,"Feeding a natural, unprocessed diet is needed now more than ever. A complete and authoritative reference on the benefits of a raw food diet for your dog. Written by Australian veterinarian Tom Lonsdale, leader in raw feeding, this exhaustively researched book provides a suggested diet, feeding tips, and do's and don'ts. If your vet is skeptical, give him or her a copy of the book!What reviewers are saying...NORTHSHORE NEWSIt cleans their teeth, improves their breath but there are much more important reasons to give them to your dogs. A growing movement towards providing a natural diet for your canine friends has a champion for the cause in Tom Lonsdale. A veterinarian for more than 30 years, he was slow to convert to the philosophy of a natural diet for dogs. But some 15 years ago he paid attention to the red flags he saw in his veterinary practice concerning the incident rate of cancer, skin irritations, gum disease and more. His research led him to the conclusion that the commonly used highly processed dog food was the main culprit. A diet of raw food with selected vegetable was the answer and the results spoke for themselves when he witnessed the improvement in his canine patient's health after making the switch. His book is a clear endorsement of a raw diet and is aimed at pet wonders who are interested in wanting to learn more than the basic information on this dietary plan. He tell the history of how the raw diet evolved and in the process discusses the current canned and dried foods available. Lonsdale goes into detail on what is actually included in processed dog food. This is a technical book, which covers a great deal of material and refers to a variety of studies and their findings. Pet owners who are interested in learning the details behind this break form what has become the normal diet will find a great deal of information here. Lonsdale passionately believes that all dogs will benefit from a raw food diet and presents an impressive case for that belief.

Tom gives excellent information that gives you very logical and scientific reasons to feed a natural diet, much like the dog's wild ancestors ate.This book will open your eyes! It will teach you to feed your animals in a way that may have never occurred to you before. You'll be surprised how efficiently your animals will consume their meals, and how completely your animal can digest bones.The most noticeable improvement you will notice when feeding this diet, is that &quot;doggie breath&quot; eventually disappears. Feeding fresh raw carcasses has an extremely beneficial effect on oral hygiene in pets.There are many, many internet support groups for feeding your pet a &quot;raw meaty bone&quot; diet. You can buy this diet in any grocery store, or you may prefer to buy in bulk through a buying co-op or at a wholesale meat supplier. This is a very cost-efficient way of feeding, because your animal will consume a lot less food overall. Try to avoid the pre-packaged raw diets if you can. Although they have many benefits, they do not provide proper oral stimulation, and will not clean your pet's teeth. They also do not support local growers and businesses, which is so important in the current sluggish economy.Tom Lonsdale is a long-practicing veterinarian, who has dedicated his life to promoting a natural way of feeding pets. I thought that Dr. Lonsdale was a very sincere, compassionate man, whose goal in teaching his diet principals, was to truly promote the best interests of our companion animals.I will hope you will read this book, and apply the knowledge gained from it to your own animals health and well-being. I highly recommend his book!",1
Behind Bars: Surviving Prison,"A judge hands down a stretch in a local, state, or federal prison. It's time for some serious life lessons.

Unless they have themselves had the misfortune to get caught up in the maw of our criminal justice system or have a close family member who has, they generally have no idea of how our systems of prisons are operated. Many of them have the notion that prison inmates loll around on their bunks all day watching TV or while away their days lazily shooting baskets out in the prison yard. Reading this book, co-written by one who has actually served some substantial prison time, will quickly disabuse them of those notions.Prisons today are essentially warehouses where inmates are shuffled from place to place like cattle. You will learn how at any given time, there are a hundred or more buses transporting prisoners from one prison to another all over the country and that some prisons actually have their own airports, at least one of them capable of receiving commercial jets! There are now nearly 2 million people incarcerated in jails and prisons across American and nearly twice that many if you include those on parole or probation.This is a no-nonsense book that give you the low-down on the prison system in America today and how to survive within it. For those who may feel that this book will never apply to them, don't be so sure. The United States is now one of the most tightly regulated and policed nations in the world. There are so many laws on the books these days that even lawyers and judges can't figure them all out. It is not as hard for a law-abiding citizen to unwittingly run afoul of the law as one may believe. Have a couple of drinks at dinner and have the misfortune to have a car wreck that results in fatalities - or hit a pedestrian - and you will likely serve some time in prison for manslaughter. If your neighbor decides to grow some marijuana plants in the back corner of your property, it is YOU who will likely have your property seized and a stiff mandatory prison sentence will be meted out to YOU and not your neighbor, unless you can afford a good lawyer to prove otherwise. With all the laws on the books these days, the possibilities are virtually endless. That is why this book should be read by all. For it is indeed possible that even a non-violent, law-abiding citizen such as yourself may someday land in jail or prison.The authors of this book do not have a political agenda, like most other books on this subject. They do not take the side of the inmates nor do they seem to have a vendetta against those who run our prison system. They simply discuss life in prison as it exists today and they provide very practical and sound advice for those who must enter into it.What I found most disturbing about this book was that our prison system is doing virtually nothing to rehabilitate prisoners and to prepare them for their re-entry into civilization. Inmates seeking to serve their time and better themselves so that they can start a new life outside the prison walls are frustrated at every turn. Education inside the prison walls are barely tolerated and even frowned upon by prison authorities, who fear loss of control (when inmates get educated and can, for example, write intelligent letters to the media about prison conditions). Inmates must deal with hostility and indifference and must learn to survive in a brutal atmosphere where at any time, they could get ""shanked"" by a fellow inmate or ""thrown into the hole"" for simply trying to defend themselves. One of the great tragedies is when a first-time prisoner serving a short sentence for some non-violent crime such as marijauna possession is victimized so badly by his fellow inmates that he is forced to defend himself or join a prison gang for protection. If he should kill one of his tormentors, his 3-5 year sentence has now been converted to life. If he befriends the prison gang, he begins to hang with hardcore criminals and his chances of staying out of prison once he gets out is greatly reduced.I'm no bleeding heart liberal. Prisons should not be fun places to be. Anybody leaving the prison system should never want to go back there again. But I do believe that our prison inmates should be prepared to lead productive lives when they are released from prison. Otherwise, they will have no choice but to link up with the bad elements that got them into prison in the first place. Putting released inmates on a Greyhound bus with a cardboard box and a $5 bill is insane. Might as well just install revolving doors on those prisons.",1
Reversing Multiple Sclerosis: 9 Effective Steps to Recover Your Health,"Multiple sclerosis is a debilitating disease that has long been regarded almost beyond the possibility of successful treatment. For many patients a diagnosis of MS has meant the end of a normally functioning life. Not any longer. Celeste Pepe was a vigorous 42, a busy chiropractor and naturopath, when she got an MS diagnosis. What does an expert in alternative medicine do when she gets seriously ill? Dr. Pepe realized it was time to put her deep belief in alternative medicine to the test. She resolved to find and employ effective natural ways to reverse this condition and restore her health. She did, and her multiple sclerosis is now a thing of the past. Dr. Pepe's remarkable healing odyssey took her through many disciplines, theories, and practices in the world of natural medicine, and into the depths of her own body and mind. In the end, she distilled her successful treatment into a program that any MS patient can follow to restore health. She explains this with clarity, medical precision and a strong measure of encouragement. Using her own healing experience, Dr. Pepe explains the steps that can help the MS patient turn the corner on this disease: detailed nutrient testing and fortification, bee venom treatment, allergy testing and dietary changes, personally tailored nutritional plans, the use of specialized supplements, chelation therapy, regular exercise, and the replacement of mercury amalgam dental fillings.

Moyer,99/104,5.0,968803200,What love! What devotion! Truly sweet and sincere ...,"Sweet and sincere best describe this lovely collection of love letters from Ronald Reagan to Nancy Reagan. The media seemed to show that Nancy Reagan was a control freak and overbearing during The White House years, this book tells another story. The story is of a man and a woman deeply in love and totally committed to one another. What impressed me most was the sweetness and the vulnerability of this once very powerful man.Many of the letters have been scanned from the original copies so you get a real taste of the time and the personality of Ronald Reagan. The letterhead is often from various places and penned in his own handwriting. These letters show his most private and personal feelings of loving his wife and just how much she meant to him. You also get some insight into his sense of humor and in his ability to love and express love. I was charmed by the feeling that he never took his position(s) in government life so seriously that he lost his true core and his true heart.At first I was a bit shocked that Nancy Reagan would share something so personal because that was not the impression I once had of her. I also wondered what was in it for her? Fame, she has, fortune? But I later learned the proceeds from this book will benefit the Alzeimers Foundation. Whatever her motivation this is a wonderful surprise of a book and a great way for her to share some really neat things about one of our ex-presidents.",1

(Well, I do love reading :-)This book will change the way you look at the world, the way you look at yourself, the way you think, and so on. It is cleary one of the best books on Math I've ever read so far (I do love Math as well :)Instead of throwing you the formulas, the authors lead you to the Mathematical Thinking. How to think this, how to solve that. What Mathematic really is and what are its applications, and why it had been used that way. All explained through simple but fun-to-think example/problems. Using non-technical language, and almost no formula(!). In fact, almost everyone with little math background can enjoy this book. It doesn't seem to require anything more than middle school math. So, you can really see the pictures, the very big pictures, clearly in your mind, which is really importand.With the wide range of content, from Prime Numbers to Chaos, Fractals, Infinity, 4th Dimension, and more. The concept of each is well-explained, in a manner I mentioned earlier. This book will definitely help you to understand the making of &quot;modern&quot; science better.One more thing is: Mathematic is not something that far from our everyday life as some might think. It's the alternative way to view our everyday life. The way with reason, pattern, logic, relation betweening things, and more. (Well, I realized this before start reading this book. But for those who haven't realize, this book will open the door for you).Math can also be fun. (In fact, it IS .. That's why I love it :-)And this book tell you why, and how to find and feel those &quot;fun&quot; and enjoy Math. Without any complicated computation, and limited only by your imagination.",1

The moment Ivan stumbled upon a clearing in the dense Carpathian forest, his life was forever changed. Atop a pedestal encircled by fallen leaves, the beautiful princess Katerina lay still as death.

Stranger in a Strange Land : ( Science Fiction Book Club Ltd Edition ),"The original uncut edition of STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND by Hugo Award winner Robert A Heinlein - one of the most beloved, celebrated science-fiction novels of all time. Epic, ambitious and entertaining, STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND caused controversy and uproar when it was first published and is still topical and challenging today. Twenty-five years ago, the first manned mission to Mars was lost, and all hands presumed dead. But someone survived... Born on the doomed spaceship and raised by the Martians who saved his life, Valentine Michael Smith has never seen a human being until the day a second expedition to Mars discovers him. Upon his return to Earth, a young nurse named Jill Boardman sneaks into Smith's hospital room and shares a glass of water with him, a simple act for her but a sacred ritual on Mars. Now, connected by an incredible bond, Smith, Jill and a writer named Jubal must fight to protect a right we all take for granted: the right to love.",['Robert A.

I won't go into details (you can find them easily on the net) but essentially the cut down version is not written in Heinlein's ""voice"" but drastically cut down (by RAH) to fit into a length the publisher thought proper.And so it does not sound like any other Heinlein novel, and this has split the ""Stranger"" camp right down the middle. There are those to whom the original book was bible -- and those tend not to like other Heinlein works. Those of us who love Heinlein have always felt kind of ""meh"" about Stranger... until the uncut version was released (in 1991).Now, the Kindle version being sold is the cut version, so if you were a fan of that (published in 1961) you'll love this version. However, if you are not a huge fan of that version I would stay away from this Kindle version at all costs (there are easily found web versions of the uncut novel -- I'm not advocating piracy, but it's unlikely we'll ever see a Kindle uncut version as Amazon seems clueless here -- even official reviewers seem to think this version is uncut, but I can promise you it isn't, as the passages are clear and easy to find in even the sample version).One last thing -- if you have read the cut version (either this Kindle version or otherwise) you might want to give the uncut version a try. Also, if you are new to Heinlein and want to know what all the fuss is about, definitely read the uncut version. Watered down beer tastes just like that.",1

I found that very helpful, and I find the Portuguese offering very helpful too, but not in quite the same way. This one makes us work harder, and that is really a good thing. The basic format is the same, but the dialogues are mainly given in Portuguese only without their English equivalents. The sections are also shorter than in the Italian job, with fewer of the exercises in the book represented on the two cd's, although the 24th and final section is a long and patient summary of the pronunciation, which many English-speakers find tricky.I had a little previous knowledge of Portuguese dating from a holiday in Portugal in 1974. This time I'm going to Brazil. The Portuguese spoken there is not quite the same, the differences being mainly in pronunciation but to some extent in vocabulary and spelling as well. Both versions are given in this course, but I'd say that it's not a lot harder to master both than to master one, and my recommendation to users of the course is to go with the flow and not try to cut bits out. Portuguese is roughly as difficult as French, and rather more difficult to begin with than Spanish or Italian, but all the languages descended from Latin have a strong family resemblance, and anyone starting with some grasp of Spanish, Italian or French will be a couple of rungs up the Portuguese ladder already.The way they have gone about this course makes the first steps harder than in the Italian course, with less spoon-feeding. One has to concentrate fairly hard to keep abreast of the spoken Portuguese without its English equivalent, especially where the dialogue is not in the printed text. However if we grit our teeth and battle through we will achieve more fluency faster this way, and that makes it worth the effort. In case it helps, my own way of doing it is to go through the book listening to the spoken dialogue first, then go through the book on its own learning the vocabulary and the verbs, then repeat the two processes as often as necessary. Listen carefully to the pronunciation each time and don't stop over the bits you don't understand, I'd say. Keep moving, keep going back over it, and before very long it's surprising how much sinks in.I shall be going to Rio, and I am informed on unimpeachable authority that the population of Rio think the denizens of Sao Paulo are all bank managers, while the inhabitants of Sao Paulo think those of Rio are all beach-bums. The chapters in this course are basically designed for tourists, but a fair attempt has been made at balancing the two cultures. I am principally going to visit my daughter who is on an extended holiday, but I shall also be renewing my acquaintance with an old university friend, long resident in Sao Paulo, who is, er, a bank manager. This gives me both the opportunity and the obligation to learn the course in its entirety, and I am finding already that this is really the simplest approach in the long run and that cutting corners just makes it all more complicated.",1

An Introduction to the Gospel of John (Anchor Bible Reference Library),"The last book by the renowned biblical scholar, this exploration of the Gospel of John brilliantly provides a profound yet accessible framework for understanding its theological, historical, and literary significance.",['Raymond Edward Brown'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BMjYAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=BMjYAAAAMAAJ&q=An+Introduction+to+the+Gospel+of+John+(Anchor+Bible+Reference+Library)&dq=An+Introduction+to+the+Gospel+of+John+(Anchor+Bible+Reference+Library)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Anchor Bible,2003,http://books.google.com/books?id=BMjYAAAAMAAJ&dq=An+Introduction+to+the+Gospel+of+John+(Anchor+Bible+Reference+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],,0385507224,,ALVNIFLFWOTDG,Bahij Bawarshi,99/103,5.0,1074297600,A master interpreter's last contribution,"Before his sudden death in 1998 Raymond Brown was working on a revision of his widely acclaimed two-volume commentary on the Gospel of John (Anchor 29, 29A). What he left behind was a nearly completed new Introduction which, however, needed to be edited before publishing. The job fell to the highly qualified Francis Moloney, himself the author of several well-received publications on John. The result is a very valuable updating supplement to Brown's earlier work. My attempt to give something of the content and flavor of this book is of necessity selective.The major effort is Brown's, but the contribution of Moloney is substantial. He supplies (1) a helpful editor's introduction, (2) a speculative conclusion, (3) an excursus on narrative-critical approaches to the Gospel of John (adapted, mostly word for word, from a similar excursus in his Sacra Pagina commentary), (4) an excursus on the history of the Johannine community, (5) editor's notes to clarify or add to Brown's text, (6) the outline and major themes of chapters 13-21 that Brown did not get around to writing, and (7) updates of Brown's bibliographies. Not least interesting are those instances where the two scholars differ. Thus, in his Introduction Moloney debates the Johannine use of Son of Man, and again in an extended note where Brown first dismisses Moloney's 1976 exegesis of two relevant verses (p. 257, n.87). He objects to Brown's references to the replacement of Jewish institutions and is much happier when Brown, rather, speaks of their fulfillment. Whereas, had Brown written the outline and themes of chapters 13-21, he would (presumably) have approached what appears to be contradictions and repetitions in 13-17 in terms of the historical development of the Gospel, Moloney looks at the text as we have it and sees unified themes and careful structure in a reverse A-B-B'-A' pattern.The question inevitably comes up: How does the new Introduction differ from the original one of 1966? The subjects covered are the same and arranged in the same order. Some of the changes, where they occur, are purely stylistic (unnecessary words unloaded, all Brown's ""we"" references to himself replaced by ""I""). Yet the rewriting can be incisive, too. The ending of the section dealing with influences on the religious thought of the Gospel is similar in both editions; but what was almost a casual statement in 1966 has been turned into a most thought-provoking question: ""The Fourth Gospel claims to be dependent on the testimony of a disciple who was particularly loved by Jesus ... Is this not also a claim to a certain connaturality of thought between Jesus and those responsible for the development and writing of John?""Other changes are more far-reaching. In 1966 Brown proposed five stages in the composition of the Gospel. These have been collapsed into three, partly because some critics found the original theory too complex. With less than innocent humor he remarks that ""a number of reviewers found counting up to five very difficult ..."" (!) The modified theory corresponds to what is generally accepted for the composition of the synoptic gospels. Brown's exposition of apologetic motifs covers the same groups as before (adherents of John the Baptist, etc.) but he is now clear in the belief that the apologetics ""pertain to the context out of which the Gospel developed [referring to the Johannine community's controversies with other groups] rather than to its purpose."" He does not think the purpose of the Gospel was to refute or to persuade non-believers but to strengthen the faith of those who already believed. Moloney concurs. The section dealing with apologetics against the Jews has been completely rewritten and expanded. Previously Brown considered that ""the Jews"" designated the Jewish authorities, but now recognizes that it refers broadly to all such Jews whose role in the narrative is to oppose Jesus. He candidly admits, ""I did not wrestle with this issue sufficiently in my first edition, and the flood of writing on the subject since that time has caused me to be more careful."" Under Crucial Questions in Johannine Theology a new section on Christology has been added, with Son of Man and Wisdom motifs treated in detail. (Wisdom Motifs was a sub-section of Theology in the original Introduction.)Moloney detects a shift in Brown's position, who now gives more attention to studying the Gospel as it stands. How much this would have influenced Brown's projected revision of the commentary is a matter of speculation. One may conclude that Brown would not have given up the historical-critical method at which he excelled, but in addition to it would have benefited from the scholarly work of others in developing new approaches to the Gospel of John.Anyone who has followed the writings of Raymond Brown, admired his analytical prowess, and perceived that his lucid prose is as much a tribute to his clear thinking as it is to his writing skill, would not want to miss this final gift from one who has justly been called a great scholar and a master interpreter.",1

Recipes From My Life,,,,,,,,,,B000OXM1RS,,A39ABKRS1MKFTW,Cynthia K. Robertson,99/102,5.0,1104278400,"Conroy as artist, writer, mad chemist & cook...","Pat Conroy is my favorite author, and it is fitting that he dedicates the same passion for cooking as he does for his writing in his new book, The Pat Conroy Cookbook. The fact that Conroy is so fascinated with food is in itself ironic. Conroy grew up in a house where food was important, but good food was not. In fact, he regrets that his mother ""looked upon food as a necessity, not a realm of art."" Her idea of seafood every Friday night was fish sticks. This all changed when his wife announced that she was going to law school, and he would have to start preparing the meals for his family (consisting of three young daughters). Conroy is an avid reader and a keen observer, so he began his education in earnest. First, he went to the local bookstore. Instead of recommending something basic and easy (like Betty Crocker), the owner talked Conroy into purchasing a book by the French chef, Escoffier. Soon, he was immersed in the world of making stock, roux and exotic foods. He discovered that cooking could be great fun, and combined the skills of being an artist with those needed to become a mad chemist.As part of his culinary education, Conroy also became an avid collector. He collected cookbooks, and especially enjoyed those homey books published by churches and civic groups. They not only offered great recipes, but also precious nuggets of knowledge such as ""store mushrooms and string beans in a brown paper bag in the refrigerator, not in plastic."" Next, he started a collection of culinary friends. Some were cooks, some were chefs, and others just enjoyed good food. Then he started collecting recipes. Many came from friends and family, others he created or recreated. He added foods to his repertoire (things such as white asparagus and escargot). He took a number of cooking classes, and finally, he started traveling. Living in Rome and France for extended periods introduced him to whole new cuisines. While I'm not sure that Conroy has become a master chef, he certainly must be an accomplished one.But you can bet that Conroy would not be content to just compile recipes for a book. The Pat Conroy Cookbook reads more like a memoir with a generous helping of recipes sprinkled here and there. Each chapter describes a story, saga or anecdote about his life, and is then followed with related recipes. He tells of preparing a bridesmaid's luncheon for his daughter, cooking for his dying father, and foods to make for funerals. He talks about foods from Italy and France, and honeymooning in Umbria. He provides chapters on oyster roasts, pig roasts, Vidalia onions, and grilling. He regales us with the best meals that his has eaten-both in restaurants and out. And he tells us of the relationship between food and his writing.The recipes themselves are interesting, intriguing and not too intimidating. For those that are more complicated, Conroy takes us through them step by step. He also provides the reader with some of those nuggets of wisdom he so admires in church cookbooks, such as drain fried foods on paper bags and not paper towels. I will definitely try a number of them-especially the low country specialties like shrimp and grits, crab cakes, and pickled shrimp.So whether you like Pat Conroy or cooking, you will love this cookbook. Not only will it tempt your palate, but it will also provide the reader with a generous dose of ""The World According to Pat Conroy."" What a tasty treat, indeed.",0

I believe, for someone who has low a prescription, they can improve to see perfectly in a short period of time because I saw a big improvement in my vision for the first 3 months after I did the exercise.

"Intelligence Matters: The CIA, FBI, Saudi Arabia, and the Failure of America's War on Terror","In this explosive, controversial, and profoundly alarming insider’s report, Senator Bob Graham reveals faults in America’s national security network severe enough to raise fundamental questions about the competence and honesty of public officials in the CIA, the FBI, and the White House. For ten years, Senator Graham served on the Senate Intelligence Committee, where he had access to some of the nation’s most closely guarded secrets. Following the attacks of September 11, 2001, Graham co-chaired a historic joint House-Senate inquiry into the intelligence community’s failures. From that investigation and his own personal fact-finding, Graham discovered disturbing evidence of terrorist activity and a web of complicity: • At one point, a terrorist support network conducted some of its operations through Saudi Arabia’s U.S. embassy–and a funding chain for terrorism led to the Saudi royal family. • In February 2002, only four months after combat began in Afghanistan, the Bush administration ordered General Tommy Franks to move vital military resources out of Afghanistan for an operation against Iraq–despite Franks’s privately stated belief that there was a job to finish in Afghanistan, and that the war on terrorism should focus next on terrorist targets in Somalia and Yemen. • Throughout 2002, President Bush directed the FBI to limit its investigations of Saudi Arabia, which supported some and possibly all of the September 11 hijackers. • The White House was so uncooperative with the bipartisan inquiry that its behavior bore all the hallmarks of a cover-up. • The FBI had an informant who was extremely close to two of the September 11 hijackers, and actually housed one of them, yet the existence of this informant and the scope of his contacts with the hijackers were covered up. • There were twelve instances when the September 11 plot could have been discovered and potentially foiled. • Days after 9/11, U.S. authorities allowed some Saudis to fly, despite a complete civil aviation ban, after which the government expedited the departure of more than one hundred Saudis from the United States. • Foreign leaders throughout the Middle East warned President Bush of exactly what would happen in a postwar Iraq, and those warnings went either ignored or unheeded. As a result of his Senate work, Graham has become convinced that the attacks of September 11 could have been avoided, and that the Bush administration’s war on terrorism has failed to address the immediate danger posed by al-Qaeda, Hezbollah, and Hamas in Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen, and Somalia. His book is a disturbing reminder that at the highest levels of national security, now more than ever, intelligence matters.","['Bob Graham', 'Jeff Nussbaum']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HI1zkhz9H9kC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=HI1zkhz9H9kC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Intelligence+Matters:+The+CIA,+FBI,+Saudi+Arabia,+and+the+Failure+of+America%27s+War+on+Terror&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Random House,2004-09-14,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HI1zkhz9H9kC&source=gbs_api,['Political Science'],,B0006IU3HQ,,A1S8AJIUIO6M9K,Robert David STEELE Vivas,99/102,5.0,1095033600,"One of Top Five Books on Topic, But Has Some Gaps","Edit of 20 Dec 07 to add links.The negative reviews on this book are by people that have not read the book carefully (one appears to have not read it all, having only seen the author on television). I am comfortable, on the basis of my career in intelligence, my three published books on intelligence (two with forewords by Senators, one Democratic, one Republican), and my 1100+ reviews on non-fiction about national security issues, is saying that this book is easily one of the top five books on the topic that most Americans should consider reading. The other four are the Webster Tarpley's book9/11 Synthetic Terror: Made in USA, Fourth Editionwhich displaced the utterly imcompetent and unethical 9-11 Commission Report, the Aspin-Brown Commission Report (1996), Jim Bamford's book,A Pretext for War: 9/11, Iraq, and the Abuse of America's Intelligence Agenciesand George Allen's book on the failure of intelligence in Viet-Nam,None So Blind: A Personal Account of the Intelligence Failure in VietnamThere are many others, but for 9-11 and the urgently needed reforms to intelligence after 9-11 (three years ago, still no reforms of note), these are the five.The book is most important as an unclassified record of what can be known about our failures--in both intelligence and in policy--as understood by the then serving Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI). It does have gaps--it is much less detailed than the 9-11 Commission Report, harder to read than Jim Bamford's book, and suffers from considerable gaps in both what went wrong and what needs to be fixed, as covered by my own books as well as the many other intelligence reform books that I have reviewed in their own Amazon spaces. That does not diminish its relative value as a ""touchstone"" for all Americans.There are, in my view, three compelling bottom lines in this book that cannot be ignored:1) Senator Graham recognizes better than most that in the absence of public pressure for reform, there is little incentive for Congress or the Executive to take action. As one Member is reported to have told Amy Zegart ""America still does not get it--it will take another 5,000 body bags."" It is my view that the combination of intelligence community leadership misrepresentation (""its all better now, no need to make major changes"" and the White House denial that there was an intelligence failure at all, which defies understanding, have led the country to fall asleep again--a point that ""Anonymous"" makes inImperial Hubris: Why the West Is Losing the War on Terror.2) Page 243 covers both of the other two points. The first is that the Department of State has become a neglected orphan in US intelligence and US policy making about global threats, and this needs to change. It is worthy of note that the Department of State got it right on Iraq despite its small numbers and tiny budget, and I agree completely with Senator Graham--State has to get back in the business of being America's *primary* foreign and national security policy strategist. I put togetherTHE SMART NATION ACT: Public Intelligence in the Public Interestbut State leadership at this time is intellectually and morally challenged (2007).3) Although disappointing in its brevity, especially since both the Aspin-Brown Commission and the 9-11 Commission found cause to note the importance of open sources of information, Senator Graham also notes on page 243 that a primary corrective measure to the failure of the intelligence community to ""connect the dots"" and related ""incestuous amplification"" lies in combining a renewed primary by the Department of State with greatly increased investments in Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) such as Congressman Rob Simmons (R-CT-02) is planning to put into the House Armed Services Committee legislation addressing 9-11 deficiencies.Senator Graham joins Dick Clarke (whose book,Against All Enemies: Inside America's War on TerrorI strongly recommend) in condemning both Saudi Arabian sponsorship of terrorism, and the bi-partisan Clinton-Bush pandering to the Saudi's, accepting despicable sustained actions by the government of Saudi Arabia against the government and people of the United States of America, for the sake of cheap oil (see also the book by Michael Klare, and by Robert Baer). While I distinguish to an extent between Saudi intelligence, which sponsors terrorism, and Saudi royalty, which tried to deny its roots in Arabia, the bottom line is that both governments knew that Bin Laden was being nurtured by Saudi intelligence, and both chose to ignore the danger.Senator Graham ends his book by lamenting the lack of accountability in both intelligence and policy. He is completely correct. George Tenet failed to resurrect the clandestine service in the seven years he served as Director of Central Intelligence, and then had the audacity to tell the 9-11 Commission that he needed seven more years to do this, now that he realized it was broken. No way, Jose. It is time to fire all the losers that have been testifying to Congress on how they would do things differently, and bring in the people who resigned their commissions in order to go public from 1985-2001. It is noteworthy that both the House and the Senate have failed to ask the latter to testify--virtually all of the witnesses on 9-11 are from the crowd that allowed 9-11 to happen in the first place.Intelligence matters, indeed. It is clear from this book that the public does not yet grasp this, and it is not clear from this book that Congress ever will. The current legislative proposals are still in lip-service, cosmetic mode. The Members are still too reliant on ignorant staff and still too prone to substitute press conferences for deep discussions with the top 15 practitioner-authors who know what is needed.There *will* be another 9-11, and there *will* be a ""nuclear hell-storm"" in America, courtesy of Al Qaeda.

The Varieties of Religious Experience: A Study in Human Nature (Being the Gifford Lectures on Natural Religion Delivered at Edinburgh in 1901-1902),,,,,,,,,,B000QU75SO,,AUY7L0SJNUM95,"C. Sahu ""Cathy Sahu""",99/102,5.0,958694400,A Great Book by a Great Man,"The previous reviews are very good descriptions of this book. I'd like to reiterate that it helps while reading to remember that this is primarily a study of many case histories of very personal and profound experiences with God. They are mostly in the form of excerpts from autobiographies and memoirs, mainly Christian and contemporary (the book was published in 1903), but many also from other times and faiths. There is no addressing the pros and cons of organized religion here, or, for that matter, of questions like whether miracles really happen, etc.This book is a microcosm, though. James touches on so many matters of religion and, indeed, life and philosophy overall that the book makes valuable reading for anyone interested in humans generally.He talks, of necessity, quite a bit about the subconscious, which had just recently been &quot;invented,&quot; showing that profound religious experiences comes from there, though that doesn't mean that they're not of divine origin: perhaps it's our subconscious self that connects to God.James then analyzes these experiences from the pragmatic point of view of, Are these experiences healthy? What are their &quot;fruits&quot;?But there are no ultimate &quot;Answers&quot; of the kind you find suggested in other works of philosophy or theology. Despite some heady speculation towards the end, James sticks to the facts, and never expects his audience to accept anything unproven.Especially interesting, I thought, were the descriptions of ""conversion,"" a two-fold experience consisting of spiritual crisis and of release from that crisis and the reaching of a profound state of surety and, usually, happiness. Besides many others, he describes the conversion processes of John Bunyan (a schizophrenic) and Leo Tolstoy. James makes the very interesting comparison of the process (nowadays called &quot;being born again&quot;) with the natural process of adolescence, and speculates that conversion crisis, as encouraged by the Protestant churches, is perhaps one of the healthiest and safest ways of attaining adulthood.Also fascinating is James' description of ""the Healthy-minded Individual,"" who is born with a trusting assurance of God's loving presence, and who never goes through any crisis of conversion because he doesn't need to. I myself would doubt the existence of these lucky people, but then I recalled a person (my children's teacher) who is always cheerful, energetic, and kind, and who I sincerely believe has never lost her temper or been anything more than necessarily stern with her students, parents, and other teachers. She has a profound, almost instinctive, faith in God. That for me is living proof of the veracity of James' categories and conclusions.And James' own almost chivalrous kindness, honesty, and respect for us, his audience make me feel that he himself, whether ""once-"" or ""twice-born,"" had reached that higher level of morality and happiness; it made reading this book a profound and inspiring experience.Oddly, the preface (by Martin E. Marty) of the version of &quot;Varieties&quot; that I have (Penguin) does not mention the following, found in the preface to the William James volume of the &quot;Great Books&quot; series:&quot;James had been concerned with religion from an empirical point of view as early as 1869, when he had noted in a review the 'anomalous' and 'discreditable' attitude of a so-called enlightened society toward psychical phenomena. To ascertain the appropriate 'stall or pigeonhole' for these 'wild facts,' he helped organize the American Society for Psychical Research in 1884. Two years later he was invited to give the Gifford Lectures on Natural Religion at the University of Edinburgh.&quot;On a vacation climb in the Adirondacks in 1898, James underwent a variety of religious experience: 'It seemed as if the Gods of all the nature-mythologies were holding an indescribable meeting in my breast with the moral Gods of the inner life....Doubtless in more ways than one, things in the Edinburgh lectures will be traceable to it,' he wrote his wife. The climb, however, overtaxed his heart, which would not have impaired his health if he had not essayed the Adirondacks the following summer and lost his way. There followed two years of complete collapse. Thus the Gifford Lectures were not finished until 1902, when they were also published in book form as 'The Varieties of Religious Experience.'&quot;",1

General Grant was just a man, just a human being, just an author...The fact remains and cannot be dislodged that General Grant's book is a great, unique and unapproachable literary masterpiece. There is no higher literature than these modest, simple Memoirs. Their style is at least flawless, and no man can improve upon it."" Highly recommended. Author — General Ulysses S.

Yes you will pay a little more, but you will get a better quality edition, and you will get 200 pages of letters written by Grant, including letters sent to Lincoln and Halleck. These letters give you an even better insight of Grant the general/husband /person.If there is anyway at all possible that you can spend the extra $9 I recommend doing it. If you are on a shoe string budget then buy this edition. It is a 5 star memoir, even without the letters.I have a full review at the other edition, but I will say that I cannot recommend Grant's memoirs enough. It really is an awesome book.",1
I know this much is true,"With his stunning debut novel, She's Come Undone, Wally Lamb won the adulation of critics and readers with his mesmerizing tale of one woman's painful yet triumphant journey of self-discovery. Now, this brilliantly talented writer returns with I Know This Much Is True, a heartbreaking and poignant multigenerational saga of the reproductive bonds of destruction and the powerful force of forgiveness. A masterpiece that breathtakingly tells a story of alienation and connection, power and abuse, devastation and renewal--this novel is a contemporary retelling of an ancient Hindu myth. A proud king must confront his demons to achieve salvation. Change yourself, the myth instructs, and you will inhabit a renovated world. When you're the same brother of a schizophrenic identical twin, the tricky thing about saving yourself is the blood it leaves on your bands--the little inconvenience of the look-alike corpse at your feet. And if you're into both survival of the fittest and being your brother's keeper--if you've promised your dying mother--then say so long to sleep and hello to the middle of the night. Grab a book or a beer. Get used to Letterman's gap-toothed smile of the absurd, or the view of the bedroom ceiling, or the influence of random selection. Take it from a godless insomniac. Take it from the uncrazy twin--the guy who beat the biochemical rap. Dominick Birdsey's entire life has been compromised and constricted by anger and fear, by the paranoid schizophrenic twin brother he both deeply loves and resents, and by the past they shared with their adoptive father, Ray, a spit-and-polish ex-Navy man (the five-foot-six-inch sleeping giant who snoozed upstairs weekdays in the spare room and built submarines at night), and their long-suffering mother, Concettina, a timid woman with a harelip that made her shy and self-conscious: She holds a loose fist to her face to cover her defective mouth--her perpetual apology to the world for a birth defect over which she'd had no control. Born in the waning moments of 1949 and the opening minutes of 1950, the twins are physical mirror images who grow into separate yet connected entities: the seemingly strong and protective yet fearful Dominick, his mother's watchful ""monkey""; and the seemingly weak and sweet yet noble Thomas, his mother's gentle ""bunny."" From childhood, Dominick fights for both separation and wholeness--and ultimately self-protection--in a house of fear dominated by Ray, a bully who abuses his power over these stepsons whose biological father is a mystery. I was still afraid of his anger but saw how he punished weakness--pounced on it. Out of self-preservation I hid my fear, Dominick confesses. As for Thomas, he just never knew how to play defense. He just didn't get it. But Dominick's talent for survival comes at an enormous cost, including the breakup of his marriage to the warm, beautiful Dessa, whom he still loves. And it will be put to the ultimate test when Thomas, a Bible-spouting zealot, commits an unthinkable act that threatens the tenuous balance of both his and Dominick's lives. To save himself, Dominick must confront not only the pain of his past but the dark secrets he has locked deep within himself, and the sins of his ancestors--a quest that will lead him beyond the confines of his blue-collar New England town to the volcanic foothills of Sicily 's Mount Etna, where his ambitious and vengefully proud grandfather and a namesake Domenico Tempesta, the sostegno del famiglia, was born. Each of the stories Ma told us about Papa reinforced the message that he was the boss, that he ruled the roost, that what he said went. Searching for answers, Dominick turns to the whispers of the dead, to the pages of his grandfather's handwritten memoir, The History of Domenico Onofrio Tempesta, a Great Man from Humble Beginnings. Rendered with touches of magic realism, Domenico's fablelike tale--in which monkeys enchant and religious statues weep--becomes the old man's confession--an unwitting legacy of contrition that reveals the truth's of Domenico's life, Dominick learns that power, wrongly used, defeats the oppressor as well as the oppressed, and now, picking through the humble shards of his deconstructed life, he will search for the courage and love to forgive, to expiate his and his ancestors' transgressions, and finally to rebuild himself beyond the haunted shadow of his twin. Set against the vivid panoply of twentieth-century America and filled with richly drawn, memorable characters, this deeply moving and thoroughly satisfying novel brings to light humanity's deepest needs and fears, our aloneness, our desire for love and acceptance, our struggle to survive at all costs. Joyous, mystical, and exquisitely written, I Know This Much Is True is an extraordinary reading experience that will leave no reader untouched.",['Wally Lamb'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=v9uqxTiOxq8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=v9uqxTiOxq8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=I+know+this+much+is+true&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Harper,1998-06-03,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=v9uqxTiOxq8C&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],101.0,B000HYTF96,,,,99/102,5.0,963532800,An Emotional Roller-Coaster,"Like some other reviewers, I was initially a little gunshy about starting to read a 900-plus page book about a pair of twins, one of whom is a paranoid schizophrenic. However, the first chapter graps your attention and the next thing you know, you are halfway through the book and looking forward to coming home to it every night.Lamb was woven a tapestry of characters who come alive and stay with you, not the glamorous models and young aggressive attorneys of most bestsellers these days, but real people. The book is narrated by Dominic Birdsey, a 40-ish housepainter and former teacher who feels a tremendous burden in caring for Thomas, his identical twin. Often told in flashback, the passages recounting school trips and summer jobs involving the two brothers are so vivid, and so heartwarming, they almost become your own memories.Perhaps the most original portions of the book revolve around the long-hidden manuscript of Dominic's maternal grandfather, an Italian immigrant, which Dominic reads (as his world crumbles around him) to try and uncover clues regarding his family's past, and specifically regarding his own father's identity. This &quot;book within a book&quot; steals the show, with its coarse Italian style and the unmistakable bravado of the grandfather-narrator.The novel is tied up almost a little too neatly at the end, as if Lamb saw the size of his manuscript and decided to quickly wrap things up. That's almost a testament to the enjoyment I had in reading the book, as I thought, after 912 pages, that it ended too quickly.However, as the bibliography at the end makes clear, the author has clearly done his research regarding paranoid schizophrenia and the difficulties faced by caregivers. Many of the flashbacks are woven into the plot through Dominic's therapy sessions. What started out as a sad and moving tale of sickness and brotherly devotion ultimately turned into a novel of spiritual renewal and awakening. I give it a big thumbs up.",1
The Varities of Religious Experience: a Study in Human Nature,"The Varieties of Religious Experience: A Study in Human Nature is a book by the Harvard psychologist and philosopher William James comprising 20 lectures given at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland.

Surviving a Spiritual Mismatch in Marriage,"Someone came between Lee and Leslie Strobel, threatening to shipwreck their marriage. No, it wasn’t an old flame. It was Jesus Christ.Leslie’s decision to become a follower of Jesus brought heated opposition from her skeptical husband. They began to experience conflict over a variety of issues, from finances to child-rearing. But over time, Leslie learned how to survive a spiritual mismatch. Today they’re both Christians--and they want you to know that there is hope if you’re a Christian married to a nonbeliever. In their intensely personal and practical book, they reveal:* Surprising insights into the thinking of non-Christian spouses* A dozen steps toward making the most of your mismatched marriage* Eight principles for reaching out to your partner with the gospel* Advice for raising your children in a spiritually mismatched home* How to pray for your spouse--plus a 30-day guide to get you started* What to do if you’re both Christians but one lags behind spiritually* Advice for single Christians to avoid the pain of a mismatch","['Lee Strobel', 'Leslie Strobel']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jc4ewsi7lgIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=jc4ewsi7lgIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Surviving+a+Spiritual+Mismatch+in+Marriage&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Zondervan,2010-12-21,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jc4ewsi7lgIC&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],23.0,0310220149,9.46,,,99/102,5.0,1017446400,"Much-needed help for ""unequally yoked"" couples!","I've been looking for a book like this for years! As a Christian married to a spiritual skeptic, I've wrestled with all sorts of emotions, pain, and difficulties. Finally, a couple who has actually lived in an ""unequally yoked"" marriage has written a biblical, practical guidebook for how to deal with the inevitable conflicts that arise in such relationships. This book has it all -- how to get through the arguments and disagreements; how to raise children in a spiritually confusing environment; how to talk to your spouse about God; how to pray for your partner (the book includes a 30-day prayer guide); and so on. It also features chapters on whether Christians should even date non-Christians; what to do if you and your spouse are both Christians but one is less spiritually mature than the other; and how to handle the situation if your spouse is a member of another religion.I thought the advice was sensitively presented, biblically sound, and resoundingly practical. The authors, Lee and Leslie Stroebel, draw on their own experience of having been married during a time when Leslie was a Christian and Lee was an atheist. While my spouse isn't an atheist, the counsel they offer was totally relevant and useful.Let me add one other thing. I've been trying at my church to start a group of people who are married to non-Christians, but I've been stymied as far as what resource to use as a curriculum. This book includes a wonderful ""application guide"" that's a roadmap for a group like this. Now those of us who find ourselves ""unequally yoked"" can get together and encourage each other while learning together how to survive our mismatched situations.If you're a Christian but your husband or wife isn't, you MUST have this book. If you know someone who's in that situation, please let them know that this resource can help them in a hundred different ways. And if you're the leader of a church, either a senior pastor or women's ministry director, check out this book and consider starting groups to minister to the Christians in your congregation who are wrestling with the difficulties presented by a spiritual mismatch.",1
The Winter Queen,"The thrilling family saga of five unforgettable women who remade Europe From the great courts, glittering palaces, and war-ravaged battlefields of the seventeenth century comes the story of four spirited sisters and their glamorous mother, Elizabeth Stuart, granddaughter of the martyred Mary, Queen of Scots. Upon her father's ascension to the illustrious throne of England, Elizabeth Stuart was suddenly thrust from the poverty of unruly Scotland into the fairy-tale existence of a princess of great wealth and splendor. When she was married at sixteen to a German count far below her rank, it was with the understanding that her father would help her husband achieve the kingship of Bohemia. The terrible betrayal of this commitment would ruin ""the Winter Queen,"" as Elizabeth would forever be known, imperil the lives of those she loved, and launch a war that would last for thirty years. Forced into exile, the Winter Queen and her family found refuge in Holland, where the glorious art and culture of the Dutch Golden Age indelibly shaped her daughters' lives. Her eldest, Princess Elizabeth, became a scholar who earned the respect and friendship of the philosopher René Descartes. Louisa was a gifted painter whose engaging manner and appealing looks provoked heartache and scandal. Beautiful Henrietta Maria would be the only sister to marry into royalty, although at great cost. But it was the youngest, Sophia, a heroine in the tradition of a Jane Austen novel, whose ready wit and good-natured common sense masked immense strength of character, who fulfilled the promise of her great-grandmother Mary and reshaped the British monarchy, a legacy that endures to this day. Brilliantly researched and captivatingly written, filled with danger, treachery, and adventure but also love, courage, and humor, Daughters of the Winter Queen follows the lives of five remarkable women who, by refusing to surrender to adversity, changed the course of history.",['Nancy Goldstone'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AOsvDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=AOsvDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Winter+Queen&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,"Little, Brown",2018-04-10,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AOsvDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],11.0,B00024YAVY,,A2U2EV70Q3IIXN,Captain Seadog,99/102,4.0,1054080000,A pleasing first novel,"by an interesting author. I recommend you search the web for ""Boris Akunin"" interviews, as well as other reviews of this book (they are overwhelmingly positive). Since the Editorial Review above adequately describes the novel, I'm not going to re-hash it and perhaps inadvertantly spoil something for a future reader. Instead, I'll use this space as I believe it's intended (namely, to tell you what I liked and disliked about the book).As one of the managers employed by the world's largest bookstore chain I am exposed to, and actually find the time to read, a great number of mystery books. As such, and despite the need to overlook some of the far-fetched aspects of the plot (but hey, what's a secret agent story without a bit of unreality), I hereby pronounce this book to be A CUT ABOVE THE NORM (that's an officially copyrighted term-of-art, of course).Seriously, though, I found this book to be quite enjoyable for, mainly, three reasons: Beautiful language, such as the opening sentence, ""On Monday the thirteenth of May in the year 1876, between the hours of two and three in the afternoon on a day that combined the freshness of spring with the warmth of summer, numerous individuals in Moscow's Alexander Gardens unexpectedly found themselves eyewitnesses to the perpetration of an outrage that flagrantly transgressed the bounds of common decency;"" the exotic historical settings (1876 Russia AND England); and, most importantly, superior characterization. The author does a good job of evolving a likeable but naive and pampered low-level agent (Erast Fandorin) into a more experienced but still wet-behind-the-ears, high-level agent (keep in mind the Fandorin adventures will span 12 books and many years in Erast's life, so there are probably better showings to come from our hero). Where Mr. Akunin (whose pen-name translates from the Japanese, or so I've read, as ""villain"" or ""evil"") really excels is in his creation of likable/sympathetic/ruthless ""bad guys."" In my opinion, nothing completes a work of violent entertainment like a great villain (think Alan Rickman in Die Hard, if you'll pardon the switch from books to movies). While it is, admittedly, pretty easy to spot the bad guys from a jaded-reader point-of-view, I can understand why Fandorin doesn't suspect them earlier given his level of experience in things cloak and dagger. Regardless, Akunin is able to overcome minor weaknesses in the story through positive characterization and interesting plot twists.On a final note, just so you don't think this book is just for mid-thirties, male, computer-chair Jim West's, the Winter Queen was also read and enjoyed by one of my co-workers, a book-devouring, semi-retired, 70+ year-old woman.I hope you like the book.",1

There followed two years of complete collapse. Thus the Gifford Lectures were not finished until 1902, when they were also published in book form as 'The Varieties of Religious Experience.'&quot;",1

I reviewed several books at the library before purchasing one as a guide to this project. The &quot;Owner-Builder Book&quot; and the accompanying CD I received after purchasing the book solidified our approach to organizing to build. Its step by step approach, the ideas presented by the author and the side bars from other owner-builders caused us to re-evaluate many of our preconceived concepts on how to build a home. Three items of significant importance were driven home when we followed the approach:1)Its easy to design a home! However, to then build it for a reasonable price is a real challenge. The ideas for a cost down approach in the book are invaluable in focusing the owner-builder with a budget and big ideas. Of particular interest was the admonition to get multiple bids! We have found price differences of over 100% from the same bill of material. We would never have realized the importance of multiple bids without using &quot;Owner-Builder&quot; as a guide.2) Our research and experience since purchasing the book last March are right on with the observations of the Smiths. General contractors spend little time at any individual project. The quality of work is up to the lead worker. The quality we have found is variable depending on which house we visited.3) You cannot do too much planning and we needed a guide for the planning process. We plan to build next March and taking a year to plan the task is not too much time. We will easily spend more than 1000 hours before the first shovel hits the site. We will know what is in the home from top to bottom. The book drove this point home and its organizational steps were invaluable.",1

Now its story has a unique voice. In this epic novel Edward Rutherfurd takes the reader on a magnificent journey across sixteen centuries from the days of the Romans to the Victorian engineers of Tower Bridge and the era dockland development of today. Through the lives and adventures of his colourful cast of characters he brings all the richness of London's past unforgettably to life.",['Edward Rutherfurd'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mVDHRVJwaiAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=mVDHRVJwaiAC&dq=London&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Random House,2010-12-23,http://books.google.com/books?id=mVDHRVJwaiAC&dq=London&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],,051743427X,,A3JM2U8EONZZL7,Brian Jay Jones,99/102,4.0,949017600,"2,000 Years of London Life -- Long, But Worth the Effort","This is a big, sprawling, initially intimidating (mainly because of its heft) but ultimately rewarding read -- a journey that follows several British families, from all walks of life, through 2,000 years of London's history. You'll start with the Druids and Caesar's crossing of the Thames, and finish with The Blitz and a bit of modern arachaeology. In between, you'll watch history come to life (each chapter revolves around a major event in British history), with the usual artistic embellishments expected of historical fiction. But it's all in the name of good fun, so don't be a stickler -- sure, modern-day English didn't come out of the mouths of the Tudors, but who cares? Rutherford is, for the most part, faithful to reporting events As They Really Happened and to Life As It Really Was.While it's the Ducket/Doggett/DuQuette family that serves as the focus of the book (keep looking for those folks with the webbed fingers and the shock of white hair as you read), it's the City of London itself (and, arguably, its architecture) which is the book's real showpiece. Be prepared to stick an extra bookmark at the front of the book where the maps are, because you're going to need it. If there was a Roman road leading out a City gate, Rutherford has marked it in the text and you're going to walk down it eventually, so get your bearings early. The cast of characters also grows exponentially through the years, as family trees are wont to do, so keep the page of the family trees marked as well.This isn't a novel (as the cover proclaims) so much as it is a series of vignettes linked by a constant (and consistent) narrative and cast of characters, and Rutherford makes the most of it. There's some laugh-out-loud bawdiness in here, a dash of The Classic Chase (a la Keystone Kops), a bit of high drama, a few nods to Shakespeare, and even a bit of the Prince and the Pauper. Rutherford makes good use of his time, but there ARE instances when things seem to get wrapped up rather too quickly and too neatly in order to clear the way for the next chapter.The middle sections of the book seem to move the fastest, which makes sense, given the historical period this portion of the book covers -- the Glorious Revolution, the Civil War, the War of the Roses, and a peek at a Henry VIII who's the biggest skunk you'll ever see this side of Richard III.There's also some real beauty in here, and Rutherford doesn't skimp on the details of British life and living that really make the book come alive.It's going to take some time to get through, and you WILL find yourself thumbing back and forth between chapters, maps, and family trees to keep everything sorted out, but it's well worth it. Set aside a week or so, put aside nitpickiness, and just enjoy watching Rutherford go to work.",1

Sahu ""Cathy Sahu""",99/102,5.0,958694400,A Great Book by a Great Man,"The previous reviews are very good descriptions of this book. I'd like to reiterate that it helps while reading to remember that this is primarily a study of many case histories of very personal and profound experiences with God. They are mostly in the form of excerpts from autobiographies and memoirs, mainly Christian and contemporary (the book was published in 1903), but many also from other times and faiths. There is no addressing the pros and cons of organized religion here, or, for that matter, of questions like whether miracles really happen, etc.This book is a microcosm, though. James touches on so many matters of religion and, indeed, life and philosophy overall that the book makes valuable reading for anyone interested in humans generally.He talks, of necessity, quite a bit about the subconscious, which had just recently been &quot;invented,&quot; showing that profound religious experiences comes from there, though that doesn't mean that they're not of divine origin: perhaps it's our subconscious self that connects to God.James then analyzes these experiences from the pragmatic point of view of, Are these experiences healthy? What are their &quot;fruits&quot;?But there are no ultimate &quot;Answers&quot; of the kind you find suggested in other works of philosophy or theology. Despite some heady speculation towards the end, James sticks to the facts, and never expects his audience to accept anything unproven.Especially interesting, I thought, were the descriptions of ""conversion,"" a two-fold experience consisting of spiritual crisis and of release from that crisis and the reaching of a profound state of surety and, usually, happiness. Besides many others, he describes the conversion processes of John Bunyan (a schizophrenic) and Leo Tolstoy. James makes the very interesting comparison of the process (nowadays called &quot;being born again&quot;) with the natural process of adolescence, and speculates that conversion crisis, as encouraged by the Protestant churches, is perhaps one of the healthiest and safest ways of attaining adulthood.Also fascinating is James' description of ""the Healthy-minded Individual,"" who is born with a trusting assurance of God's loving presence, and who never goes through any crisis of conversion because he doesn't need to. I myself would doubt the existence of these lucky people, but then I recalled a person (my children's teacher) who is always cheerful, energetic, and kind, and who I sincerely believe has never lost her temper or been anything more than necessarily stern with her students, parents, and other teachers. She has a profound, almost instinctive, faith in God. That for me is living proof of the veracity of James' categories and conclusions.And James' own almost chivalrous kindness, honesty, and respect for us, his audience make me feel that he himself, whether ""once-"" or ""twice-born,"" had reached that higher level of morality and happiness; it made reading this book a profound and inspiring experience.Oddly, the preface (by Martin E. Marty) of the version of &quot;Varieties&quot; that I have (Penguin) does not mention the following, found in the preface to the William James volume of the &quot;Great Books&quot; series:&quot;James had been concerned with religion from an empirical point of view as early as 1869, when he had noted in a review the 'anomalous' and 'discreditable' attitude of a so-called enlightened society toward psychical phenomena. To ascertain the appropriate 'stall or pigeonhole' for these 'wild facts,' he helped organize the American Society for Psychical Research in 1884. Two years later he was invited to give the Gifford Lectures on Natural Religion at the University of Edinburgh.&quot;On a vacation climb in the Adirondacks in 1898, James underwent a variety of religious experience: 'It seemed as if the Gods of all the nature-mythologies were holding an indescribable meeting in my breast with the moral Gods of the inner life....Doubtless in more ways than one, things in the Edinburgh lectures will be traceable to it,' he wrote his wife. The climb, however, overtaxed his heart, which would not have impaired his health if he had not essayed the Adirondacks the following summer and lost his way.

Personal memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant (Great commanders),"General Grant's personal memoirs are a must read for all Civil War buffs and those even remotely interested in history. This book, which includes both Volume I and II, articulately spells out the military career of one of the United States' greatest generals. Grant's memoirs are well-written, thoughtful, insightful, and offer more than a glimpse into the mind of U.S. Grant. Volume I opens with a heartfelt preface where Grant explains how his diminishing health pushed him to complete this work and ""asking no favor but hoping (his remarks) will meet the approval of the reader."" They most definitely do. Following the preface, the reader is given a (very) short review of his early childhood, life at West Point, and early Army life. The next one hundred pages are dedicated to the Mexican War followed by his resignation from the military and civilian life in Illinois. The remainder of Volume I and all of Volume II extensively deal with the war between the states. Volume I (written before Grant realized he was critically ill) is rich in detail of the various military campaigns and his ascension through the military ranks. Volume II hurls the reader into the conflict, reads rapidly, and is rife with Grant's personal observations and insights. This second volume picks up where the first left off--following Vicksburg to the campaigns in Tennessee to the Battle of the Wilderness to Sherman's March to the Sea to the Battle of Franklin right up to Appomattox and all the events of April and May 1865. These campaigns are told from the commanding general's perspective with great overview and detail. However, what really makes Volume II special are all the personal observations and insightful comments about those Grant served with and against. Grant is thoughtful and displays much about himself as this great book draws to a close. An eloquently written, detailed, first-person account of the Civil War that offers much to those who read it.",['Ulysses S.

Dr. Airola not only writes and presents the material well, but he also transmits a charm and a positiveness that is healing in and of its own self. Dr. Airola practiced what he preached--what is in his books are the results of his clinical experience. No Bravo Sierra here.I'll offer my testimomial here. What is in his book worked for me and worked in three weeks. The M.D.'s failed after three years. The experience moved me enough to study natural medicine in depth to the practitioner level. Dr. Airola's book were the first textbooks. Despite being layman's books, they are chocked full of knowledge.Should you use this book, be prepared to juice. You need to either grow your own herbs or find good sources since the capsuled stuff in healthfood stores is garbage.In this book, you will see a diet that is the progenitor of the some of the more recent popular diets, except that Airola's worked and has stood the test of time. The treatments for specific disease are complete, comprehensible, and usually on one or two pages.One of the beauties of this book is that one who knows nothing of natural healing can take this book and get started right away to heal themselves, gain a strong backbone into natural healing, and turn their live's around.To the negative, there is no information given on how to make herbal preparations. There is more to herbalism than eating a weed and Dr. Airola just gave the principle herbs for a specific treatment. In most cases, that would fine, however I suggest a good herbal or a practicing herbalist who makes their own brews to help in the preparation.This book is an excellent first book for the prospective student of natural medicine (or biological medicine as Dr. Airola called it). It would be my first choice if one asked me for a guide to curing themselves, and it should be found to be an indespensible addition to one's library. It is the only book I loan to people and I have been through 3 copies as it gets worn out and stained over time.",0

A Room With a View,"Featuring an appendix of discussion questions, the Diversion Classics edition is ideal for use in book groups and classrooms. Lucy Honeychurch journeys from England to Italy on holiday hoping to broaden her world, but it’s not the beauty of Florence that she falls in love with. No, trapped in a hotel populated by nothing but fellow Britons, it’s hard for Lucy to experience Italy at all. To make matters worse, the room with the view she was promised isn’t available. Overhearing her dismay, a father and son duo offer to switch rooms with her. It is a generous gesture met with revulsion from Lucy’s suffocating chaperone, for to accept would put them in a compromising position and be a major social gaffe. Touched by the kindness of it and for the first time in her life questioning the barriers of her social standing, Lucy develops a fondness for the two uncouth gentlemen. In fact, George Emerson, younger of the two, might be the only spot of joy Lucy has in Florence. No sooner does Lucy find herself falling for George, who values her mind and spirit, when she is whisked away to Rome. There, she meets Cecil Vyse who, though domineering, pompous, and snide, matches her social standing and proposes. Lucy, thinking she is making the most practical choice, is ready to settle for Cecil. But when George moves closer to her and confesses his true feelings, Lucy must choose between her true desires and that which she was taught was best her entire life.

Girl in Hyacinth Blue,"This New York Times bestseller explores the life and many owners of an imaginary Vermeer painting in an “impressive debut collection” of linked stories (Publishers Weekly). A Dutch painting of a young girl survives three and a half centuries of loss, flood, anonymity, theft, secrecy, and even the Holocaust. This is the story of its owners whose lives are influenced by its beauty and mystery. Despite their many troubles and unsatisfied longings, the girl in hyacinth blue has the power to inspire love in all its human variety. This luminous story begins in the present day, when a professor invites a colleague to his home to see a painting that he has kept secret for decades. The professor swears it is a Vermeer—but why has he hidden this important work for so long? The reasons unfold in a series of events that trace the ownership of the painting back to World War II and Amsterdam, and still further back to the moment of the work’s inspiration. As the painting moves through each owner’s hands, what was long hidden quietly surfaces, illuminating poignant moments in multiple lives. Susan Vreeland’s characters remind us, through their love of this mysterious painting, how beauty transforms and why we reach for it, what lasts and what in our lives is singular and unforgettable. “Vreeland’s book is a work of art.” —New York Post",['Susan Vreeland'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CVAqAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=CVAqAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Girl+in+Hyacinth+Blue&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,RosettaBooks,2012-03-18,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CVAqAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],58.0,0786224401,,ARYF8JUHY2S1X,"Dianna Johnston ""Compulsive Reader""",99/101,5.0,1000425600,Unique and lovely...,"The concept of this novel, tracing the history of a painting by going back in time chapter by chapter, is just my cup of tea. Susan Vreeland has done an excellent job in transferring this unique notion to paper. I've always enjoyed antiques and wondered about its origination; Girl in Hyacinth Blue was like a dream come true in that respect.The story begins with math professor, Cornelius Engelbrecht. He was bequeathed a painting from his father, who claims it a masterpiece by the Dutch artist Vermeer. There are no papers to prove this statement; however, the bigger picture is the way Cornelius's father obtained the painting...a way that has haunted him all his life.Each chapter moves back in time to the previous owner of the painting. Readers follow the painting from the wall of Cornelius's father to the actual inspiration and creation of it. Each vignette houses new sets of characters with the painting as its central core. Slowly, with each turning page, we reveal another part of the painting's history, layer by layer, and what it has meant to the people whose lives it touched.Girl in Hyacinth Blue made for a wonderful reading experience. I recommend this novel to those who enjoy lovely period pieces or like getting to the bare bones of a story. A very in depth and beautiful premise. I have Susan's next book on my list.",1

The New Revelations: A Conversation with God,"The human race has reached a Time of Choosing. Our options are being placed before us by the tide of events -- and by those who are creating them. We can either move forward, building together at last a new world of peace and harmony based on new beliefs about God and Life, or move backward, separately and continuously reconstructing the old world of conflict and discord. The New Revelations provides us with the tools to move forward, to pull ourselves out of despair, lifting the whole human race to a new expression of its grandest vision. In this book, which offers possible and powerful answers to the questions facing the world, bestselling author Neale Donald Walsch urges us to open our hearts and minds to what may be one of the most important spiritual statements of our time. A conversation with God that began as a simple plea from one human being to the God of his understanding, The New Revelations is a life-altering book, given to us when we need it most.",['Neale Donald Walsch'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WFlrS4Hl48EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=WFlrS4Hl48EC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+New+Revelations:+A+Conversation+with+God&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Simon and Schuster,2002-09-30,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WFlrS4Hl48EC&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],4.0,B0001FZGBW,9.6,A17SZODISFM8P3,"F.

I have done a ton of reading and I've never found such a broad, advanced, and relatively accessible cosmology. Neale's last book, Communion with God, is a philosophical masterpiece that explains our confused world at its deepest levels. I've read a lot of philosophy, metaphysics and theological books. The Conversation with God books contain some of the purest truths you can find anywhere and this new book is every bit as good as the others.In The New Revelations, Neale and God continue to deliver amazingly valuable insights. This book is the most practical and the most challenging of the Conversatons with God series. It asks us to act, to become spiritual activists, to help change the world, and potentially to save it.God says that the difficulties we are experiencing with our world right now are not simply political, or religious. Our fundamental beliefs are out of wack. God is diligently non-judgemental here and asks us to drop the concept of right and wrong. Righteousness is part of the problem. God asks us to look at things pragmatically. Instead of my beliefs being right, and your's being wrong, God suggests that we simply look at the results we're getting compared to the results we want.I just returned from a weekend seminar with Neale at the Omega Institute in NY state which centered on the messages in this book. Neale asked us to become Spiritual Activists, to help others to examine their beliefs. He wants you to post the 9 New Revelations and the 5 Steps to Peace everywhere, like a modern day Martin Luther - challenge the status quo.There is no question, this is DEFINITELY great stuff. If we all do as it suggests, it WILL change the world for the better.The only problem I have is that Neale plays dumb and hands God a lot of questions that are obviously setups. Neale is much more advanced than he pretends to be here. I suppose he does this to make the material more accessible to a wider range of readers but I know he's more advanced than that. The philosophical side of me wishes Neale would raise the level of the dialog, but I'm sure that would make this less interesting to the average potential reader.",1

With people turning away from the churches they were raised in and world-weary atheists searching for spirituality, the spiritual marketplace is going through a boom period with no end in sight. But in the midst of such selection, how can one tell who's faking it, and who's the real deal? Is the teacher or author a committed seeker or a devious charlatan? Modern, sceptical Americans often avoid spirituality all together due to horror stories of silly cults and gurus perpetrating spiritual scams on the unsuspecting public. Who can we trust?How about an Australian philosopher-psychiatrist with years of experience dealing with spirituality, transpersonal psychology, and mental illness? Roger Walsh makes no claims to have attained a spurious level of ""enlightenment"" beyond a measure of basic sanity in this world gone slightly mad. In ""Essential Spirituality"", Walsh provides the perfect companion to Huxley's classic ""The Perennial Philosophy""- a book of practical spiritual exercises, advice, and wisdom from sages the world over. Divided into seven sections on what Walsh believes to be the seven essential practices of the world's ""Wisdom Traditions"", Walsh provides advice on reducing craving, cultivating emotional wisdom, living ethically, meditating, awakening the senses, growing intuition, and pursuing spiritual action. This isn't New Age mysticism- ""Essential Spirituality"" is grounded in the teachings of saints throughout the world and history, extensively documented by Dr. Walsh. Even the most sceptical mind can see the gentle wisdom in his approach to spirituality.I give this book my highest recommendation to seekers of all faiths and none- may it help you on your way.",1

Bilbo's Last Song: At the Grey Havens,"Bilbo’s Last Song is considered by many to be Tolkien’s epilogue to his classic work The Lord of the Rings.

Poignant and lyrical, the song is both a longing to set forth on his ultimate journey and a tender farewell to friends left behind.

Howard's End,"The Never-Ending Conflict Between the Old Ways and the New Ways “The tragedy of preparedness has scarcely been handled, save by the Greeks. Life is indeed dangerous, but not in the way morality would have us believe. It is indeed unmanageable, but the essence of it is not a battle. It is unmanageable because it is a romance, and its essence is romantic beauty.” - E.M. Forster, Howards End Howards End is an estate with a rich history and cultural heritage cherished by the Wilcoxes, a rich family with traditional ideas. However, the half-German Schlegeles – the new aristocracy – are not that impressed, yet Ruth Wilcox sees Margaret Schlegel as the ideal owner. That’s why on deathbed, Ruth leaves the house to Margaret in written note. The note is burnt by the husband Henry who grows fonder of Margaret with each passing day. Is Margaret bound to Howards End?

Many people were introduced to it by the film, which, good though it was, does not begin to capture the subtle wisdom Forster put into this book. Howard's End can be seen as a quaint period piece about British culture in the early Twentieth Century. On another level, however, it's a brilliant exploration of the human soul. In the Schlegels and the Wilcoxes, Forster has created the perfect embodiment of the eternal conflict between reason and passion. These two families, destined to be united by the marriage of Margaret Schlegel to Henry Wilcox, represent two seemingly irreconcilable aspects of humanity. The Schlegels are artistic, intellectual and impractical; the Wilcoxes materialistic and unapologetically bourgeois. Margaret and Henry have their differences, but it is their relatives who display the more extreme family traits. Margaret's sister Helen is a classic bohemian; Henry's son Charles is a humorless and intolerant banker. As the novel unfolds, the two families are forced to confront each other and decide whether to ultimately part company or compromise. What is most impressive to me about the novel is the naturalness and grace with which the story unfolds. When an author uses characters to embody universal qualities, it is quite a challenge to make the people and story real and not merely symbols. Howard's End succeeds brilliantly as both a thoroughly engaging novel and a rather profound metaphysical inquiry.",1

Girl in Hyacinth Blue,"This New York Times bestseller explores the life and many owners of an imaginary Vermeer painting in an “impressive debut collection” of linked stories (Publishers Weekly). A Dutch painting of a young girl survives three and a half centuries of loss, flood, anonymity, theft, secrecy, and even the Holocaust. This is the story of its owners whose lives are influenced by its beauty and mystery. Despite their many troubles and unsatisfied longings, the girl in hyacinth blue has the power to inspire love in all its human variety. This luminous story begins in the present day, when a professor invites a colleague to his home to see a painting that he has kept secret for decades. The professor swears it is a Vermeer—but why has he hidden this important work for so long? The reasons unfold in a series of events that trace the ownership of the painting back to World War II and Amsterdam, and still further back to the moment of the work’s inspiration. As the painting moves through each owner’s hands, what was long hidden quietly surfaces, illuminating poignant moments in multiple lives.

In it, the author, a man whose mother was white and his father black, tells two stories: that of his mother and his own. Tautly written in spare, clear prose, it is a wonderful story of a bi-racial family who succeeded and achieved the American dream, despite the societal obstacles placed in its way.The author's mother was a Polish Orthodox Jew who migrated to America at the age of two with her family during the early nineteen twenties. They ultimately settled down in Virginia, where she led an isolated and lonely life; shunned by whites because she was Jewish and shunned by blacks because she was white. She was raised in a predominantly black neighborhood, where her father, a despicable and harsh man who brutalized his handicapped wife, ran a local grocery store, where he priced gouged his black clientele.She left home and moved to New York when she was nineteen and never looked back. She met and married the author's father, a black man, when mixed race marriages were still frowned upon by both whites and blacks. Still, she always felt more comfortable around blacks than around whites. When he died sixteen years later, she married another black man who nurtured her eight children by the author's father and proceeded to give her four more children.The author tells of his childhood, of his family, and of the issue of race that ultimately colored his life while growing up in predominantly black neighborhoods, where his mother stood out like a sore thumb because of the color of her skin. It was always an issue his mother avoided discussing with him, as for her it was not an issue. It was not until the author wrote this book that his mother discussed the issue of race within the context of her own life. From this dialogue emerges a fascinating look at the issues of race, as well as religion, and how it impacts on an individual's identity within our race conscious society.It is also a very personal story. While the author's family was economically disadvantaged, his eccentric and independent mother always stressed education. She was a strict disciplinarian who brooked no nonsense from her twelve children. A convert to Christianity through her first husband, with whom she founded a Baptist church, she provided her children with the will to succeed. Consequently, all twelve eventually went to college and did her proud. The story of this unique family is told from two distinct, parallel perspectives: that of the author and that of his mother. While both are interesting, it is his mother's story that dominates this beautifully written book, which is, indeed, a tribute to her. It is truly a story told from the heart, as the love that the author has for his mother is evident with every written word.",1
The Early Germans,,,,,,,,,,1405117141,31.22,A3SXTEARXXCDL3,"Tim O'Neill ""Bibliophilius""",99/100,5.0,992649600,An Essential Introductory Text,"Todd's book has become the standard introduction to the history and archaeology of the early Germanic peoples in English. In a remarkably clear and concise work, Todd manages a comprehensive overview of much of the main evidence regarding the Germanic tribes which goes a long way to correcting the popular conception that they were the filthy grunting savages seen in the opening sequence of the movie 'Gladiator'.In the first part of the book he covers most of the important aspects of the culture of these tribes, covering the physical landscape of forest and marshland in which they lived, their general social structure, trade and diplomacy with Rome, burial customs, art, technology and (of course) warfare. He draws on both literary and archaeological sources of information and uses both judiciously to present a concise picture of these complex and warlike peoples.Part Two gives brief but useful summaries of the history of the major tribes who took part in the 'Age of Migrations' from the Third to the Seventh Centuries AD. He presents information on the Goths, Seubi, Vandals, Franks, Alemanni, Burgundians, Gepids, Lombards, Thuringians, Bavarians and the Scandinavian tribes, with mentions of many other minor peoples. Each of these is little more than a useful sketch ranging from four to forty pages each (consider that Herwig Wolfram's 'History of the Goths' checks in at over 600 densely packed pages), but each of these is enough to introduce the essential information about each these peoples and direct the interested reader to more extensive information. It also shows that these tribes differed from each other culturally and, to an extent, linguistically and that what is true about the Germanics in the First Century may not be so in the Sixth.The book is well illustrated with maps, diagrammes, photos of artefacts (both Germanic and Roman) and line drawings and its bibliography, while not comprehensive, is an excellent jumping off point for the reader who wishes to know more.While the Celts have become a topic of keen interest in recent years, with a plethora of books on them ranging from fine academic works through coffee table books to arrant New Age nonsense, the ancient Germanics are, in a way, the neglected peoples of the ancient world. Given that England was established by Germanic tribes and that they were in many ways the successors of the Roman world, it is a little surprising that these vibrant, warlike and artistic 'barbarians' are not far better known and understood in the English-speaking world.An excellent book for both the undergraduate student and the general reader. Along with his 'The Northern Barbarians' I can recommend this work very highly.",1

Bunyan was a preacher, a prolific writer and a shining saint for God. However when we read this book we find out that he was an atheist and infidel in his youth, enjoying sin and rebellious towards God. Inwardly he suffered from tormented nightmares of demons and judgment, but outwardly he went on pretty much as any other sinner, taking delight in sin and being the ringleader of mischief. Several times he nearly lost his life, and even though there were several close calls, still he did not turn to God. After his marriage, he participated in religious activities, went through the motions of attending church and generally lived as he pleased, each time successfully shrugging off pangs of guilt. One day, after church, while playing a sport, a voice seemed to call out to him from heaven to his soul, which said, &quot;Wilt thou leave thy sins and go to heaven, or have thy sins and go to hell?&quot; Bunyan was convinced it was the Lord Jesus looking down on him in displeasure. What follows details his sinking into despair, his desparate attempts at working his way into God's good graces, and his struggles with temptation and doubt. In a strange sort of way, it is comforting to read about Bunyan's struggles and identify with them because you can see how he turned out so greatly used by God. He rationalized, made excuses and tried every way to justify himself. Bunyan did not try to gloss over his motivations but gave an honest account of his struggles from avowed sinner, to religious hypocrite before he was finally converted. He describes in great detail his doubts and despair, his yearning to be converted to Jesus Christ, and then being assured of his salvation by reading the Bible and praying. Reading this book will help you realize how God's grace can abound and save even the most wretched of sinners and gives us abounding hope.",1
"Topoi, the Categorial Analysis of Logic (Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics)","A classic introduction to mathematical logic from the perspective of category theory, this text is suitable for advanced undergraduates and graduate students and accessible to both philosophically and mathematically oriented readers. Its approach moves always from the particular to the general, following through the steps of the abstraction process until the abstract concept emerges naturally. Beginning with a survey of set theory and its role in mathematics, the text proceeds to definitions and examples of categories and explains the use of arrows in place of set-membership. The introduction to topos structure covers topos logic, algebra of subobjects, and intuitionism and its logic, advancing to the concept of functors, set concepts and validity, and elementary truth. Explorations of categorial set theory, local truth, and adjointness and quantifiers conclude with a study of logical geometry.",['Robert Goldblatt'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AwLc-12-7LMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=AwLc-12-7LMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Topoi,+the+Categorial+Analysis+of+Logic+(Studies+in+Logic+and+the+Foundations+of+Mathematics)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Courier Corporation,2006-01-01,"http://books.google.com/books?id=AwLc-12-7LMC&dq=Topoi,+the+Categorial+Analysis+of+Logic+(Studies+in+Logic+and+the+Foundations+of+Mathematics)&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Mathematics'],,0444867112,,A1DQFVPUH3QM6W,Paul Corazza,99/100,5.0,903830400,Great introduction to the theory of toposes.,"When Goldblatt's book first hit the stands, it was blasted by reviewers who had a geometric predilection. They claimed that Goldblatt had trivialized this essentially rich geometric subject by giving a set-theoretic treatment.I became fascinated with topos theory in the summer of 1989. My only experience with category theory at that time was some dabbling that every graduate student gets in studying modules and in functional analysis. I didn't have much background in algebraic topology where the subject is usually developed considerably further.Frankly, I found Goldblatt's &quot;gentle&quot; approach to categorical concepts and the concept of a topos very rewarding. I worked through most of the book in a summer, and was fully prepared to take on the more advanced texts at that point. Later, I had the opportunity to teach topos theory at the graduate level to people with backgrounds similar to mine (i.e., without a strong background in category theory). We worked through most of Goldblatt's book in the first semester and I guarantee that all the students were very grateful, as I had been, for Goldblatt's approach to the subject.The book is well written, accessible to graduate students, filled with fun and often challenging exercises, and packed with references. In my opinion, it is the right place to start if you want to become proficient in topos theory (and you don't already have significant proficiency in category theory).",1
Angels,"`Bij een benzinestation in Mariposa vroeg ik de weg naar Bass Lake. De pompbediende, een jongen van vijftien, adviseerde mij ernstig om ergens anders heen te gaan. De Hells Angels gaan daar de boel op stelten zetten. Jezus nog aan toe, waarom zou iemand nog naar Bass Lake willen? Die gozers zijn verschrikkelijk. Ze branden de hele boel plat! Ik zei tegen hem dat ik een karatemeester was en dat ik zin had in actie. Hells Angels is een sterk staaltje gonzojournalistiek waar Hunter S. Thompson zijn faam aan ontleende. Een jaar lang trekt Thompson op met een chapter van de Hells Angels en brengt deze notoire motorclub in kaart: hij beschrijft het ontstaan van de Hells Angels, de regels en gebruiken, de kleding, de motoren en de tatoeages. Aan de hand van politierapporten, verslagen van ooggetuigen en gesprekken met de leden zelf, ontkracht Thompson de mythische verhalen die de Hells Angels omgeven en waar zijzelf dankbaar gebruik van maken om hun reputatie van `bad guys mee aan te dikken. Hoewel Thompson bevriend raakt met een paar Angels - tot grote afschuw van buurtbewoners, die van angst in elkaar krimpen als er een Harley het terrein komt oprijden - behoudt hij zijn journalistieke integriteit en weet daardoor een genuanceerd en feitelijk beeld te geven van deze legendarische motorclub. Hunter S. Thompson (1937-2005) groeide op in Louisville, Kentucky, en pleegde in 2005 zelfmoord door zich door het hoofd te schieten. Thompson maakte naam met Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, die in 1998 werd verfilmd met Johnny Depp in de hoofdrol. In 2011 verschijnt tevens Thompsons debuutroman De Rum Dagboeken, waarvan de verfilming gelijktijdig in première gaat. `Er zijn twee bijvoeglijke naamwoorden waar schrijvers iets om geven briljant en buitengewoon Thompson bezit beide Tom Wolfe `Thompson biedt ons een kijkje in een wereld waar de meesten van ons nooit voet aan wal zullen zetten.

Graham uses the Bible as his only source of information on the subject, and he does a very good job of describing the heavenly hosts to readers. The book was written largely in response to the proliferation of books centering around demonology and New Age ideas in recent years; as he points out, there really aren't many satisfying treatments available of angels per se. Sadly, modern man's conception of angels has been shaped and largely determined by popular entertainment; Graham effectively delineates truth from lies and imaginative thinking. The book is meant to inspire and comfort as much as it is to inform the reader. Graham offers many penetrating insights into the subject, but, most importantly, he lays out the basic facts about angels as they are revealed in the Bible. He describes a hierarchy of angels that is more extensive that I realized--at the top is the archangel Michael, followed by Gabriel, then cherubim and seraphim, and finally a myriad of different principalities, authorities, etc. Angels, Graham argues, perform different functions but serve only to glorify God and assist man in attaining salvation.While the concept of a hierarchy among angels seems somewhat strange, given that it necessarily implies varying levels of power and authority and, thus, inequality among these divine beings, Graham does an excellent job of explaining what angels do and, more interestingly, what they cannot do. Angels, first and foremost, praise the Lord and work for Him in all things; they serve as His divine warriors and as the protective agents of every Christian in the world. Interestingly, angels cannot preach to man or take any other action to compel man to repent of his sins because each man must make his own decision for or against Christ. One of the explanations Graham suggests for angels' inability to actively win human souls is the fact that angels do not know sin and cannot relate to the miraculous conversion from sin to faith in Christ. What I find most interesting about angels, and this is a notion borne out by Graham's writing, is the fact that they will be subordinate to saved human souls in heaven. Though born wretched, those men and women who accept God's salvation will live eternally in a closer relationship with God than the sinless angels do.Many readers will find the information on Lucifer and his fall from heaven the most interesting section of the book. I certainly cannot understand how any angel, created without sin, can somehow fall victim to pride (which Graham implies is the seedbed of all sin), especially to the point where he will challenge God for His throne and, even more amazingly, convince up to one third of all angels to join with him in the revolt. Graham does a good a job as anyone at explaining the origins of Satan (as well as the inevitable defeat of the prince of lies).The true purpose of the book is to win new souls for the Lord and to offer comfort and inspiration for those already redeemed. Graham makes the case that, for Christians, angels are always over our shoulder watching out for us, that they love each of us and rejoice each time a new soul is won, and that they will be there to guide us directly to Heaven once we pass away. The only weakness of the book is, ironically, also its greatest strength--it is written so that anyone can understand it. While I might turn away from a hefty theological tome, I would very much like to see a more detailed, scholarly treatment of the subject, especially by such an authority as Billy Graham.",1
The Flower Ornament Scripture: a Translation of the Avatamsaka Sutra,"Known in Chinese as Hua-yen and in Japanese as Kegon-kyo, the Avatamsaka Sutra, or Flower Ornament Scripture, is held in the highest regard and studied by Buddhists of all traditions. Through its structure and symbolism, as well as through its concisely stated principles, it conveys a vast range of Buddhist teachings. This one-volume edition contains Thomas Cleary's definitive translation of all thirty-nine books of the sutra, along with an introduction, a glossary, and Cleary's translation of Li Tongxuan's seventh-century guide to the final book, the Gandavyuha, ""Entry into the Realm of Reality.""",['Thomas Cleary'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NT76AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=NT76AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Flower+Ornament+Scripture:+a+Translation+of+the+Avatamsaka+Sutra&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Shambhala Publications,1993-10-12,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NT76AwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],2.0,B000N756CW,,A1OB5L3WMHJAD9,Christopher Culver,99/100,5.0,1016409600,"A massive, massively influential sutra, expertly translated","The Avatamsaka Sutra (The Sutra of the Garland of Flowers) is among the largest and greatest of the scriptures of Mahayana Buddhism. It is 12 volumes in Chinese, and 1600 pages in this English edition published by Shambhala. As with most Mahayana scriptures, it treats Buddha not as merely a man of ancient India, but as a cosmic principle. Differing from the austere and non-theist Theravada scriptures, it is full of gods and goddesses, heavens, jewelled trees and imaginary beings. The Avatamsaka Sutra became very influential in Chinese Buddhism, and was responsible for the creation of the Hua-Yen school.This edition by Thomas Cleary, THE FLOWER ORNAMENT SCRIPTURE, is excellent. It includes not only his translation of the Avatamsaka Sutra, but also a book subsequently pinned onto it (the 400-page Gandhavyuha, or ""Entry into the Realm of Reality""), the Chinese mystic Li Tongxuan's seventh-century commentary on the Gandhavyuha, a glossary of difficult Mahayana concepts, and an incredibly helpful translator's introduction.Dr. Cleary ranks among the foremost translators of Asian religious literature and always succeeds in translating works clearly and precisely. In THE FLOWER ORNAMENT SCRIPTURE, his years of experience have enabled him to produce a stunning translation, and I can only admire his persistence in translating such a massive work.This edition is really a treasure for Buddhist students. Or, should I say, serious students and scholars. At 1600 pages and a high cost (though much more inexpensive than several years ago), this tome is for the dedicated. THE FLOWER ORNAMENT SCRIPTURE, however, is an excellent translation. Dr. Cleary has benefitted Westerners greatly through his singular translation.",1

I own every book, and have recently reread them all, and without a doubt this is the very best. For one thing, it was written right in the middle of Watterson's C&H career, which means that the writing and ideas are still fresh, while super-improved drawings and Sunday strips have just begun. Second of all, Watterson must have been on a powerful creative streak, because there is an amazing number of stories within the ""Indispensible"" collection. There are three Rosalyn babysitter tales, the bug collection story, the bat project, two camping trips, G.R.O.S.S. adventures, the burglar break in, the car down the hill, multiple Stupendous Mans, multiple Spaceman Spiff getaways, the duplicator going ""boink"" and creating more Calvin's, a rare, great Tracer Bullet story, Calvin defying gravity and size, Calvin on the baseball team, and a time machine adventure to the dinosaur age. The sheer amount of stories here is unheard of for a C&H collection, and the best part is that almost every one is fantastic. Thirdly, the Sunday strips are in color, which is a huge plus. Fourthly, Calvin's parents have finally been rendered as three dimensional and sympathetic individuals, a characteristic that had been lacking in the earlier books. Last of all, as always, these comics are frequently hilarious, sometimes touching, and always entertaining. This collection personifies those characteristics to the nth degree, and is without a doubt the best Calvin and Hobbes for anyone to buy. If you're looking for other good C&H books, I would also recommend the Essential Collection (first two books, funny yet lacking in drawing), Snow Goons, Psycho Jungle Cat, Treasure Everwhere, and the 10th Anniversary. I hope this was helpful both for prospective buyers, and old fans looking back.",1

The readers have the freedom of utilizing these materials, often presented in interesting ways such as stories about famous runners, to make their own conclusions. I feel like having a very pleasant academic discussion with the author who is convincing, but not dictating while reading the book. The background of the author - ultra-marathon athlete, researcher and practicing sports MD is perfect for writing such comprehensive running book.This book is certainly not a quick recipe. It takes time to digest the material. If you enjoy reading, it is a plus. I have read some section multiple times.

Quantum mechanics underpins modern science and provides us with a blueprint for reality itself. And yet it has been said that if you're not shocked by it, you don't understand it. But is quantum physics really so unknowable? Is reality really so strange? And just how can cats be half-alive and half-dead at the same time? Our journey into the quantum begins with nature's own conjuring trick, in which we discover that atoms -- contrary to the rules of everyday experience -- can exist in two locations at once. To understand this we travel back to the dawn of the twentieth century and witness the birth of quantum theory, which over the next one hundred years was to overthrow so many of our deeply held notions about the nature of our universe.

It is BY FAR the best explanation of quantum theory for someone who is relatively (or even completely) unfamiliar with it. The author explains the theory in a step by step fashion, not leaving anything implied or unsaid, but in no way is insulting to one's intelligence. As a philosophy grad student, I especially appreciated the chapter on the various interpretations of quantum theory, including the 'many-worlds' interpretation that reminded me very much of David Lewis's metaphysical system (in which all possible worlds actually exist somewhere). I bought this book at 10:30 p.m. and had read half of it by the time I went to bed, and finished the rest of it the next day. It is that good! Highly, highly recommended.",1

Azucar! The Story of Sugar,"AZUCAR! The Story of Sugar is a fictional novel that offers a gripping testimony to the unmasked brutality and decay of daily life on a contemporary Caribbean sugarcane plantation, Esperanza Dulce. Azucar, the intelligent and beautiful young girl, is the central character, but the omnipresent protagonist is her namesake, ""azucar"" -- sugar itself. Azucar?s story is a complex and hauntingly atmospheric tale of sustained intrigue, murder, revenge, forbidden love, and an unnerving journey into the mystical spirit world of Caribbean ritual. Even after Azucar?s fiercely determined grandmother arranges for her to emigrate to Canada -- with a most unlikely couple-- where she is dramatically transformed, she is still not completely free from the hypnotic pull of the distant Caribbean plantation. Azucar meets and falls in love with Lucien, whose own mysterious history shockingly brings them both back to Esperanza Dulce to confront the terrifying ghosts of an unknowingly shared past.",['Alan Cambeira'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JFLRAAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=JFLRAAAACAAJ&dq=Azucar!+The+Story+of+Sugar&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,2001-01-01,http://books.google.com/books?id=JFLRAAAACAAJ&dq=Azucar!+The+Story+of+Sugar&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Dominican Republic'],,0972082115,14.5,A328S9RN3U5M68,Grady Harp,99/100,5.0,1072656000,Introducing A Masterful Storyteller !,"AZUCAR! The Story of Sugar is one of those 'first novels' that is so naturally excellent that it suggests a mind gifted for writing. If ever there was a novel that captured the rhythms and flavors of the Caribbean, the historical clashes and traumas of the quasi-slave market industry of sugar production, all as a stage setting for the introduction of some of the more unforgettable characters you are likely to meet in a modern novel, then this is clearly the book to read and the author to watch. Few authors can weave the interactions of such dissimilar characters as the child Azucar, her grandmother guardian who lives with the spirits of the islands richly imbedded in her personality, the multiethnic workers gathered from all the Caribbean Islands to live in the squalor of the 'batey' and be at the mercy of the plantation owners who for the most part abuse them daily, the bestiality of the sons of the Don, to the special souls of those who give Azucar succour in her journey from raped motherhood to intellectual and spiritual supremacy. Alan Cambeira glues us to the pages of this spellbinding story until the final page.Here are characters we can love, characters we can loathe, and most importantly here is a story about the value of the individual spirit in tune with the magical spiritual world of the islands. Cambeira wisely mixes his pages with phrases in Spanish, French, and Creole, and allows us to learn the music of these languages as they enhance his tale. Unlike some authors he willingly either translates the languages directly or indirectly so that the reader is never at a loss for appreciating this technique. He addresses such issues as 'slavery', ancestry, gay relationships,...and manages to be convincing in every arena.At times Cambeira drives his stories of the abuse of the sugar workers a bit too far and perhaps dwells a bit too long on descriptions of table settings and food of the well to do, but these are minor faults in telling a fine story. One wishes for a more assertive hand from an editor to polish this special gem so that every facet is appreciated, to soften the too perfect resolution of the story, but that will come. Kudos to Julio Belen for publishing and promoting this enormously fine book. There is very definitely an audience for this richly eloquent book...and a film of his story seems a natural!",1

The diet your partner will be instructed to keep is impossible for any human being alive to follow. She will be told to try and avoid ... damn near everything it seems like.I'll be blunt, WTEWYE seems to be an EXTREMELY popular gift for someone who's pregnant for the first time and it's probably unavoidable. I came into three copies without any effort at all. I'm not going to stand here and pretend I know of a better source for information either, because (outside of ... oh I don't know ... a doctor) I don't.

Your mission is to ""lose it."" If you're already stuck with it and you can't hide it or burn it, at least do your best to temper its pages with as much perspective as you possibly can.

Graham uses the Bible as his only source of information on the subject, and he does a very good job of describing the heavenly hosts to readers. The book was written largely in response to the proliferation of books centering around demonology and New Age ideas in recent years; as he points out, there really aren't many satisfying treatments available of angels per se. Sadly, modern man's conception of angels has been shaped and largely determined by popular entertainment; Graham effectively delineates truth from lies and imaginative thinking. The book is meant to inspire and comfort as much as it is to inform the reader. Graham offers many penetrating insights into the subject, but, most importantly, he lays out the basic facts about angels as they are revealed in the Bible. He describes a hierarchy of angels that is more extensive that I realized--at the top is the archangel Michael, followed by Gabriel, then cherubim and seraphim, and finally a myriad of different principalities, authorities, etc. Angels, Graham argues, perform different functions but serve only to glorify God and assist man in attaining salvation.While the concept of a hierarchy among angels seems somewhat strange, given that it necessarily implies varying levels of power and authority and, thus, inequality among these divine beings, Graham does an excellent job of explaining what angels do and, more interestingly, what they cannot do. Angels, first and foremost, praise the Lord and work for Him in all things; they serve as His divine warriors and as the protective agents of every Christian in the world. Interestingly, angels cannot preach to man or take any other action to compel man to repent of his sins because each man must make his own decision for or against Christ. One of the explanations Graham suggests for angels' inability to actively win human souls is the fact that angels do not know sin and cannot relate to the miraculous conversion from sin to faith in Christ. What I find most interesting about angels, and this is a notion borne out by Graham's writing, is the fact that they will be subordinate to saved human souls in heaven. Though born wretched, those men and women who accept God's salvation will live eternally in a closer relationship with God than the sinless angels do.Many readers will find the information on Lucifer and his fall from heaven the most interesting section of the book. I certainly cannot understand how any angel, created without sin, can somehow fall victim to pride (which Graham implies is the seedbed of all sin), especially to the point where he will challenge God for His throne and, even more amazingly, convince up to one third of all angels to join with him in the revolt. Graham does a good a job as anyone at explaining the origins of Satan (as well as the inevitable defeat of the prince of lies).The true purpose of the book is to win new souls for the Lord and to offer comfort and inspiration for those already redeemed. Graham makes the case that, for Christians, angels are always over our shoulder watching out for us, that they love each of us and rejoice each time a new soul is won, and that they will be there to guide us directly to Heaven once we pass away. The only weakness of the book is, ironically, also its greatest strength--it is written so that anyone can understand it. While I might turn away from a hefty theological tome, I would very much like to see a more detailed, scholarly treatment of the subject, especially by such an authority as Billy Graham.",1

(I'm normally a really slow reader.) Although the middle kind of drags on, with the same thesis repeated in several different forms, it's quite an enlightening read.I've always considered myself well informed and quite liberal on drug issues, but it turns out that I was much more influenced by anti-drug propaganda than I had realized. My mind has been filled with stories that are true, personal experiences, or second-hand accounts of people I trusted, but I was seeing them in the wrong light. I thought of my father performing autopsies on cocaine users whose hearts had stopped with no warning. Someone who tried to kill his roommate with an axe while tweaking on crystal. Lots of perfectly real scare stories, which had caused me to feel chills just thinking about these ""hard"" drugs.But these were still viewed through the lens of prohibition. Conveniently forgotten in these tales were the many, many more cases my father had seen of alcohol poisoning, a common cause of death among young people in the town where I grew up. Drunken rages in which people were killed - one that killed one of my best friend's bosses just two months ago. Somehow, because of the legality and familarity of alcohol, these were not ""scare stories"" about drugs. They were, instead, stories about people, and their foolishness; the blame was not transferred to the chemical.The best part of the book is his historical review of alcohol prohibition, and the hype over the evil powers of alcohol at a time when opium and cocaine were not only legal, but popular and commonly used in ""patent medicines"". He illustrates how prohibition didn't cut down on drinking for more than a few years, but instead shifted drinking towards hard liquor, a more dangerous substance that was simply easier to smuggle and conceal. Similarly, when cocaine and opium were legal, they weren't consumed in their most severe forms, but in much milder preparations such as beverages and tinctures. Prohibition, in retrospect, doesn't reduce use so much as make that use more severe, and probably more harmful.Sullum doesn't argue that drugs are always good. He seriously considers the argument that drug prohibition is justified by the harm it prevents. But he does put all drugs onto a level playing field. There is an abundance of statistics indicating the rates at which drug problems actually occur, and these reveal a huge, invisible majority of drug users - even of ""hard"" drugs like heroin and crack - who are not addicted, do not suffer severe problems, and most often stop using the drug when it no longer suits their needs. Just as with alcohol.In my mind, as is the case for many people, I had formed a hierarchy of harm. Tobacco and alcohol are not so great, but not so terribly harmful. Pot is maybe a little better, a little worse, but other things, such as crystal and PCP, are scary and dangerous. Common sense, right? Well, maybe not. When you look at actual patterns of use, these ""hard"" drugs don't look so hard anymore. It is the lack of direct experience with these things that makes us so suceptible to scare stories - the ""voodo pharmacology"" he describes, wherein these substances have the mysterious power to turn people into zombies. But, if Sullum is right, these scare stories, despite their kernel of truth, are mostly just mass hysteria. Psychologically, prohibition is hardly different from witch-burning.Sullum is saying, in effect, that drugs don't cause addiction, but rather, addicts cause addiction. That drugs don't cause criminals, but that people are criminals to begin with; that drug use and crime have a common cause, and do not cause each other except through the mechanisms of prohibition itself. That addiction adheres not to the drug, but to the user, and the availability (or not) of any particular drug is not the most relevant factor. This is a not a new idea, but it is rare to have it explained and supported so clearly and convincingly.In reading this, I find an almost existential relief. This book affirms the power of the individual to control their lives, and casts aside the superstitious, magical thinking that ascribes such amazing powers to mere chemicals. Sullum's argument becomes most interesting when he argues that drug use by teenagers is perfectly appropriate, so long as it is done with the guidance of caring role models. He points out how unreasonable it is to expect someone with no experience with alcohol to suddenly become ""responsible"" on their 21st birthday, and somehow just know how to use it appropriately. Or worse, that they should consume it furtively, with no guidance, at secret parties. Instead, he suggests that teenagers should be introduced to alcohol, among other drugs (he specifically cites marijuana) in controlled environments, preferably in the company of their parents. With a chorus of ""what about the children"" seemingly right around the corner, this is a brave statement to make. Perfectly sensible, of course, but it's always the most sensible ideas that are the most dangerous to say out loud.Is this book biased? Such questions are very hard to answer. In reading it, I was reminded of the furor over The Skeptical Environmentalist, a book full of references to scientific literature that were later criticized as being tangential, incorrect, or at best, highly selective. I was frustrated by that controversy, but didn't have the motivation to track down all the references and evaluate them for myself. In contrast, with Saying Yes, I am eagerly awaiting its challengers. Because I want to know the truth; is this guy giving us a realistic portrayal of what drugs really do, or is he, well, ""smokin' crack?""My guess is that Sullum is right on the money. Reading this book has turned me from a lukewarm anti-prohibitionist to a true drug libertarian. If he's even approximately correct, it is clear that all drugs, even the ""hard"" ones, should be made legal for anyone over 21, and that we must reject this ""voodoo"" that is granting drugs much more power than they deserve. Only then will we find balance.",1

The Smiths' book, though, has a different slant, obviously geared more to the retiree, but this book also deals with some sociological issues that the other books didn't touch on at all. Smith raises some very interesting questions, such as, ""What will Hawaii be like if/when so many baby boomers relocate there? Will the local population be able/willing to assist and support these aging immigrants? Who will control the government? How will escalating real estate prices affect the local population?"" Many of these issues are at the heart of the Hawaiian sovereignty movement, and may well affect how newcomers are greeted and treated in the future. This looming question is certainly not the only focus of the Smiths' book - it is highly readable, and contains a wealth of information for the prospective newcomer. But I found the thought provoking issues a very valuable addition to suggestions of locations, advice on moving, and many suggestions for further reading and web sites to explore. All in all, a very excellent resource - one that should not be missed by anyone interested in moving to Hawaii.",1
A Brief Tour of Human Consciousness: From Impostor Poodles to Purple Numbers,,,,,,,,,,0131872788,10.17,AOL7V6D4AL3KO,"James J. Lippard ""skeptic""",98/99,5.0,1116979200,fascinating intro to recent neuroscience of consciousness,"I attended the 2005 Skeptics Society conference on Brain, Mind, and Consciousness at Caltech, where Ramachandran had been scheduled to speak but was unable to do so because of a family emergency. Although I was not previously familiar with his work, the description led me to believe he was a speaker I would be interested in hearing, and this book, which I purchased at the conference, provides a strong case for that. I've long had an interest in philosophy of mind and cognitive science, and minored in cognitive science in my Ph.D. studies (never completed) at the University of Arizona. I've been out of academia for 11 years now, and apart from reading occasional works like Daniel Dennett's Consciousness Explained and Freedom Evolves, I've not been keeping close tabs on the field. The conference and this book were quite a pleasure--it is clear that there have been some significant developments over the last decade.It is hard to believe that there are still people who think the brain is little more than a radio receiver, a set of mechanical controls for a disembodied spirit to manipulate the body. Ramachandran's book--like the case studies of Oliver Sacks and A.N. Luria--shows how wrongheaded that view is.This is a thin (112 pages of text, 45 pages of notes), very accessible and entertaining book. If you enjoy the works of Sacks and Luria, you are likely to enjoy this as well. This is not a collection of case studies, though there are some descriptions of particular patients--it is written from a higher elevation, bringing together recent results, explaining unusual phenomena, and speculating about how those phenomena may tie in to a further understanding of the details of the brain's function.The book came from Ramachandran's BBC Reith lectures, so it is for a popular audience, with the notes providing some more underlying detail. There are five chapters, each dealing with a single topic. The first chapter is about amputees who experience pain in their ""phantom limbs"" and how the parts of the brain which had been devoted to the now-absent limbs can become mapped to still-present parts of the body which are handled by physically proximate parts of the brain. For example, a patient whose left arm had been amputated could feel contact to the nonexistent fingers of his left hand from touches to parts of his face or upper arm. Ramachandran then uses this remapping phenomenon to speculate about the causes of Capgras' syndrome (where a patient believes people he knows have been replaced with impostors), synesthesia, and pain asymbolia, where a patient responds to pain stimulus with laughter.The second chapter is about vision, and specifically about the phenomena of blindsight (where a person has no experience of seeing, but at an unconscious level does see), hemisphere neglect, and mirror agnosia. In this chapter Ramachandran discusses ""mirror neurons,"" neurons found in monkeys which activate when a monkey performs some task, but also when the monkey sees another monkey perform the same task.The third chapter, ""The Artful Brain,"" is the most speculative, and provides Ramachandran's suggested ten ""universal laws of art,"" which he offers as features we find aesthetically pleasing in art, and discusses some reasons why those features might be pleasing to the brain.The fourth chapter deals in more detail with synesthesia, the perception of stimuli with multiple senses, such as experiencing colors corresponding with sounds or numbers. He links this to cross-activation of sites in the brain (similar to his discussion in the first chapter), points out some similar phenomena that most people share (such as a tendency to associate certain kinds of abstract shapes with certain sounds or names), and speculates that such associations may have paved the way for the evolution of language from non-verbal communication.The fifth and final chapter is titled ""Neuroscience--The New Philosophy."" Ramachandran discusses how some of the phenomena of neuroscience might bear on questions from philosophy of mind about qualia, free will, and self-awareness. The chapter doesn't get very deep into any of these philosophical issues, but it's clear that more has been learned in the last few decades of neuroscience than in the last few millenia of philosophy.I highly recommend this book as an introduction to these topics.",1
Lie Down with Lions,,,,,,,,,,B000DEN1G8,,A1ECF4HZLRYY4Y,"Volkswagen Blues ""cead1""",98/99,4.0,984614400,"Solid, action-packed crowd-pleaser","It's unfortunate that one of the previous reviewers found so much to hate in &quot;Lie Down With Lions,&quot; and I'm guessing it's because that reader was looking for the wrong things. No, Follett's not Faulkner, and you'll get no musings on the human condition. But that's not why one reads Follett; you read Follett for the tightly written, superbly constructed thriller, and, in &quot;Lie Down With Lions,&quot; that's exactly what you get.The action is intense, right from the outset, where American agent Ellis blows his cover in Paris, losing in the process his girlfriend Jane, who takes up with another guy and heads with him to Afghanistan, to offer medical assistance to a populace wearied by war against the invading Soviets (sort of a 1980s version of M&eacute;decins sans fronti&egrave;res). Ellis tails her there, under the auspices of the US government, to train the Afghan fighters. At which point, the plot thickens, and doesn't let up till the very end.The dynamics of the Ellis/Jane relationship are great, very natural and well drawn in a way one doesn't usually find such relationships drawn in action novels. Their moments of greatest intimacy--including an amazingly and erotically written love scene that rivals anything in Miller or Joyce--help drive one of the novel's main tensions, a tension between the reader's responses to these two characters who are often at odds but both very sympathetic. This tension, though, merely underscores the real, action-based tension surrounding the military skirmishes taking place on the greater stage outside the Ellis/Jane relationship.As some reviewers have pointed out, &quot;Lie Down With Lions&quot; isn't much use as a history primer on the war in Afghanistan, or as a probing meditation on the nature of existence. But that's really beside the point. We read Follett, like we read Clancy and Grisham, because they're amazingly talented story tellers with interesting stories to tell. I've read &quot;Lie Down With Lions&quot; three times and enjoyed it immensely each time.",1

With so many approaches to meditation, it's a relief to find an experienced practitioner who eloquently maps out the elements of Buddhist meditation in relationship to the balanced development of both wisdom and compassion. In particular, I found it very helpful the way the author divides the practice of 'samatha' or tranquility meditation and 'vipassana' techniques or insight meditation. The explanation of the Four Immeasurables (kindness, compassion, empathetic joy, and equanimity) and how they balance our practice that's useful to others as well as ourselves was also invaluable. The writing is condensed and to the point with many jewels of wisdom. I found myself underlining almost every other sentence.

Emotional Life of the Toddler,"Now updated with new material throughout, Alicia F. Lieberman’s The Emotional Life of the Toddler is the seminal, detailed look into the varied and intense emotional life of children aged one to three. Hailed as “groundbreaking” by The Boston Globe after its initial publication, the new edition includes the latest research on this crucial stage of development. Anyone who has followed an active toddler around for a day knows that a child of this age is a whirlwind of explosive, contradictory, and ever-changing emotions. Alicia F. Lieberman offers an in-depth examination of toddlers’ emotional development, and illuminates how to optimize this crucial stage so that toddlers can develop into emotionally healthy children and adults. Drawing on her lifelong research, Dr. Lieberman addresses commonly asked questions and issues. Why, for example, is “no” often the favorite response of the toddler? How should parents deal with the anger they might feel when their toddler is being aggressively stubborn? Why does a crying toddler run to his mother for a hug only to push himself vigorously away as soon as she begins to embrace him? This updated edition also addresses twenty-first century concerns such as how to handle screen time on devices and parenting in a post-internet world. With the help of numerous examples and vivid cases, Lieberman answers these and other questions, providing, in the process, a rich, insightful profile of the roller coaster emotional world of the toddler.",['Alicia F.

The book addresses tantrums, separation anxiety, sleeping problems, toilet training and more from the point of view of the toddler. It helped me to understand that these things are a really big deal to a toddler even though they don't seem like it to me. I also realized a lot of the advice you read in other books may work to stop the behavior but are actually very emotionally damaging to the kid. For example ignoring them when they are having a tantrum is emotionally damaging to the child, because anger is a very scary emotion for them and they need help learning how to deal with anger. If you ignore them, you reinforce to them that anger is scary, they also think you don't love them anymore because you are ignoring them, and they eventually start repressing their anger (and we all know from recent studies that repressing anger is a large cause of stress and heart disease).Since reading this book, I have changed how I relate to my son (18 months)and it has been great! He has almost no tantrums anymore, he cooperates with me when I ask him to, and we are both A LOT happier together. I highly recommend this book!!

After several hours or days of careful painting, gluing and assembling, you had a human figure with clear plastic skin, through which were visible the skeleton and internal organs. Best of all, you could remove the chest plate and remove those insides to study how they all fitted together. It was one of the coolest model kits ever, and an invaluable anatomical reference for the budding surgeon or the medically curious. It was also a tempting target for little hands.Well, Uncover the Human Body, written by Luann Colombo and illustrated by a host of artists, safely satisfies the curiosity of the owners of those little hands, and also delights their parents (or in this case, uncle) with its clever construction and wealth of useful and fascinating information. Each page is made of sturdy cardboard, and the entire center of the book is cut out in the shape of a human figure. Suspended within this cutout by support rods of clear plastic are parts of the skeleton and the various organ systems (minus the reproductive system) - eight layers in all, including the front cover. It's based on the same concept as those acetate pages in an encyclopedia that show human anatomy, but in this case the body parts are sculpted in the round from plastic, affording an even more coherent view of just how all those ""guts"" fit together inside your body. It even includes the musculature of the left arm and leg.The text is well-researched and clearly-written with children in mind. It can be read aloud to younger children, and those who already read well can enjoy it on their own. The fact entries have humorous titles, such as ""Gimme Some Skin!"" and ""Of All the Nerve!"" Difficult words are italicized and followed by pronunciation guides. The scientific names for body functions are paired with the more commonly-used terms with which children may already be familiar. It contains fun little experiments children can do with little or no supervision, such as the de-calcification of a chicken bone in vinegar and a recipe for fake blood.However, this is not strictly kid stuff. I've been an armchair anatomist for decades, and yet I learned things from the text that were never quite clear to me or that simply had not been addressed in my studies. (For example, the exact purpose of the small intestine; atlas and axis vertebrae; lobes of the lungs; that when you feel thirsty, you're already a little dehydrated, etc.)A few words of caution: the book does contain small plastic parts that could be broken or ripped out, so keep it out of reach of children under three years or who tend to break their toys. Also, the model is not intended to be removed from the book, and would not fit together properly without the support of the pages anyway. These caveats aside, Uncover the Human Body makes a great gift for children who are endlessly fascinated by the body and how it works.",1

And there's a black and white drawing on almost every other page, which is perfect, because most young children still need a picture to look at while they're listening.The best thing about the book for me was that even though there's plenty of action (mostly involving the little boy outsmarting a series of wild animals in order to reach the dragon), there's nothing the least bit scary here. That was very important to me as the mother of a four-year-old. The book was written in the forties, and it has a sweet, gentle, old-fashioned quality that it's hard to find in any form of entertainment for young children today. (Even Disney is too intense for a lot of four-year-olds.) It has the kind of innocence most of us would like our children to be able to hang on to for a few years.My son loved the book so much we read it over and over again, and went on to read the other two books in the series (Elmer and the Dragon and The Dragons of Blueland) many times as well.Years later, when he was in third grade, his teacher mentioned to me that she was hunting for a chapter book to read to the class, but wasn't having much luck. Everything she looked at seemed beyond the attention span of many of the kids in her class. I told her about My Father's Dragon, but I also said it probably wasn't exciting enough to hold the attention of third graders.

The author dos not only misunderstand Progressivism, he misunderstands the entire political spectrum. Unfortunately, this stems from the fact that he knows absolutely nothing about history, even though his argument is historical! It used to be that conservatives accused liberals of being communists; an accusation that stemmed from the same misunderstanding of history that Goldberg's argument stems from. Any political ideology, with the exception of extreme libertarianism or anarchism, can somehow be connected to some thinker or some statement that supported either the fascists or the communists in the early 20th century.Its the same way people try to make a connection between evolutionary theory and eugenics. Some people, who by and large were not scientists, misappropriated the views of Darwin and applied them to human societies. Goldberg's argument follows the same line of reasoning - guilty by association. The same argument can be turned on conservatives - modern American conservatism has a very distinct connection to racist/segregationist policies in the American South. Trying to connect FDR ir Hillary Clinton to Hitler is a much further stretch of reasoning than drawing an ideological comparison between Ronald Regean and the KKK.By the way, this guy was embarassed on the Daily Show.

It is a thought worth bearing in mind while reading 'The Quantum Brain,' the remarkable, often enthralling, new book by Jeffrey Satinover. Satinover's aim in this book is to map out a highly detailed account of how mysterious quantum properties - such as quantum indeterminacy - may be harnessed or amplified by the nervous system to allow for the exercise of free will. The course traversed by Satinover to reach this destination is not always an easy one, and it includes challenging passages on: physics, biochemistry, computer science, and chaos theory. It helps a great deal that Satinover's style is sharp, succinct, and sprinkled with elucidating metaphors. However, Satinover has the tendency to jump immediately into difficult terrain on such a wide variety of topics that a broad scientific literacy is a virtual prerequisite. That said, Satinover handles such topics as well - if not better - than a host of competing books -- like Roger Penrose's 'Shadows of the Mind.' Penrose, of course, generated considerable notoriety with his thesis that intra-cellular ""mechanisms"" called microtubules were a ""bridge"" linking the quantum realm and our everyday macroscopic world. The appeal of Penrose's view, at least in part, had much to do with his intuition that the quantum realm was somehow closely identical to a Platonic realm of mathematical Forms, thus appealing to the mystically and religiously inclined. The schema Penrose proposed - that of the macro-scale quantum field-states being generated in the brain - as well the one his collaborator Stuart Hameroff put forward - have not held up to scientific scrutiny, and Satinover convincingly shows why. But contra the arch-materialists Satinover demonstrates that the iterative architecture of the brain at different scales is conducive to amplifying quantum level uncertainty so that behavior at the classical level is non-deterministic. What I've mentioned here, of course, is a necessarily condensed summary of a much more elegant presentation. I'll add but two important details however - namely, that Satinover makes the case that quantum level ""effects,"" such as quantum tunneling, are both ubiquitous and necessary to understand classical level phenomena, and that lowest scale quantum level ""effects"" influence the initial state of the next scale, while adaptive pressures of the next higher levels shape the boundary conditions of the lowest scale. This amounts to a mutually adaptive feedback loop - an idea closely allied to what the cognitive scientist Douglas Hofstader, in his masterful 'Godel, Escher, Bach,' called a ""tangled hierarchy."" We shall return to this idea shortly. But first I'd like to set my sights on some of Satinover's philosophical conclusions. It's hardly a quantum leap (or is it?) to suggest that quantum level ""events"" - events which have no cause - bear at least a superficial relationship to the ancient Greek and Scholastic notion of God as the ""uncaused cause"" of matters material. Or likewise, as Satinover suggests in passing, that quantum level events ""function"" as the source of a continual ""creation"" that sustains the universe at every instant. (This too, is a Scholastic notion expressed by the idea of the ""exnihilating preservative"" action of God -- exnihilating means continual creation). But Satinover's theological speculations do not extend much further than this. This is an ironic disappointment, particularly since Satinover laments the possibility that mankind risks severing its cultural roots in the race towards the future. And there is indeed, a wealth of concepts and ideas to found in mankind's spiritual, artistic, and philosophical traditions, which might situate and illuminate the implications of Satinover's findings. That is to say, philosophy may be blind without the aid of science, but science may not know what too look for without the help of philosophy. Here is something of what I mean in this regard. Satinover has gone to considerable lengths to produce an argument within the empirical tradition in support of the notion of free will. It is a laudable and welcome achievement. But consider this: Science has hitherto assumed a methodological and metaphysical determinism. In a deterministic framework it is difficult - if not impossible - then, to have conceived of an experiment taking place on the wholly classical level that would disconfirm determinism (the double slit experiment, of course, is the exception). And given that the essence of a scientific theory is that it should be susceptible to disproof we are left to conclude that metaphysical determinism wasn't scientific at all - it was an article of faith (of a rather peculiar sort). More to the point, metaphysical determinism was similar to Newton's notion of an absolute frame of reference - part of the intellectual scaffolding that supported and constrained what questions made sense in a given paradigm, yet lay unexamined as the un-provable assumptions within that system. That such esteemed scientists - the Churchland's, Dennett, and Dawkins, to name a few - could manage to bully and harangue so much of the scientific community into accepting what are ultimately dogmatic assertions is a symptom of a gross philosophical illiteracy among the highest strata of empiricists (many scientists will, no doubt, take this as a compliment). Reading Satinover's concluding chapter, ""Quantum Ripples,"" I can't but help feel that some of these hidden assumptions are still at work, hampering, perhaps, a deeper appreciation of the implications of his preceding discussion. Some quantum theorists have suggested that the collapse of a superposition to an actual state isn't just a case of matter going from a state of potentiality to actuality - to use Aristotle's terminology - but that the potential for ""experience"" is inherent quantum level, but it is only through collapse of the wave function from potentiality to actuality that ""experience"" of a sort occurs - that is, quantum measurement is experience. Though presumably the amplification of the quantum capacity for experience through a human (or artificial) nervous system would be necessary for the richly textured sense of experience we as humans experience. In this case, the fundamental energy behind the universe - the quantum realm - would be conscious only adventitiously - through us. And our consciousness - our ""I"" - would be but an attribute of the noumenal - the un-conceptualizable ground of existence. William James expressed an idea not far from this - about the reciprocal relationship between man and God -- where humankind contributed to the evolution of God. Which brings us back to the notion of tangled hierarchies. A tangled hierarchy is a set of nested hierarchical levels that contain a ""strange loop."" The idea is captured most intuitively by thinking about the famous wood carvings of the Dutch artist M.C. Escher - most notably his 'Drawing Hands' in which each hand seems to give rise to or draws the other - or his 'Print Gallery' in which a young man in an art gallery stares intently at painting that curves and twists around so that it contains both the man and the gallery. It is a theme of ancient origin, arising in the 'Ramayana,' composed in the 3rd century B.C. by the Indian poet and sage Valmiki, in which the principal characters, after heroic and arduous adventures, retire to a hermitage to study the very book in which they make their appearance as fictional characters (The device also makes it appearance in one of Woody Allen's most creative films, 'Deconstructing Harry'). The iterative is implied in these examples. And so to the notion of self-similar scales within scales, as well as the mutually adaptive feedback loop and self-reference. Douglas Hofstader called the tangled hierarchy a ""strange loop"" because following the loop tended to lead to unexpected results - i.e., following an apparently outward course one is brought back to one's starting point. The idea is important in this context, I think, because, as Hofstader notes, the paradoxical nature of the tangled hierarchy requires an inviolate, discontinuous, or transcendent level without which the other levels could not exist. It is ideas such as this, dovetailing with Satinover's biological/quantum model, which could form the basis of a richer ontological framework - one in which transcendence not only fits, but is necessary. T.S. Eliot once wrote that art often anticipates revolutionary ideas later discovered by pioneering scientists and thinkers. Perhaps this is a further indication that Satinover's aim has been on target. Satinover has drawn on a vast array of disciplines to make his point. But the inherent tension of stringing together so many diverse interests has helped propel his argument. If we cannot yet tell whether he has scored a bulls-eye, a near miss, or whether others shall score the cleaner shot it is only because the target is still beyond the horizon.",1
The way,"Spanning nearly 50 years of family history, the book chronicles the remarkable lives of two creative talents, Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez. It's a story of father and son set against the backdrop of Hollywood; this narrative is organized around their physical and spiritual journey along the Camino de Santiago, Spain, the thousand-year-old pilgrimage path which traverses Galicia. It is the area from which Sheen's father emigrated to the U.S. and to which Estevez's own son has returned. Along the Waywill focus not just on the lives these men have chosen as artists, but also (and most importantly) on the one they have lived together. It is a story of family bonds and artistic advances and setbacks; of good choices and hard choices; of opportunities lost and opportunities found. Sheen and Estevez will share what they have experienced and learned from each other in their forty eight years as father and son, as fathers of sons, as actors and director, as spiritual seekers, and as concerned citizens of the world. Readers will meet them as real people rather than icons, as two men who have accumulated decades of wisdom and insight they are now ready to share.","['Martin Sheen', 'Emilio Estevez']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=X5EeoIqmjvAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=X5EeoIqmjvAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+way&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Simon and Schuster,2012-05-10,http://books.google.com/books?id=X5EeoIqmjvAC&dq=The+way&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],7.0,B0007DKRGC,,,,98/139,2.0,1076198400,Puzzling...,"I bought this because I was interested in Opus Dei. I am a devout Catholic and was interested in becoming a member of this group, and wanted to know more. Their website isn't much help - little information is contained there. I kept reading (from non-Church sources) that they are basically a secret cult within the Church, and when I tried to contact them they said I had to live near one of their main centers (Houston, D.C., etc.) in order to become a member. So, I bought ""The Way"", written by the founder of Opus Dei.Josemaria Escriva was a Spanish priest who founded Opus Dei in the 1930's, and after a few decades it became an enormously powerful and wealthy organization. They are now a personal prelature of the Church, and I still haven't found a good definition of what that is. There are plenty of anti-Catholic conspiracy theorists out there, and I don't want to add fuel to their fires, but it strikes me that perhaps some of the things I've heard about Opus Dei are true - that it's basically a secret society, that you don't know what you're getting into until you're in it, and that once you're in they try a little too hard to keep you in. I love The Church and am devoted to it, but I don't doubt that the above is true.If ""The Way"" is anything to judge by, Father Escriva was a pretty odd and fierce guy. For one thing, the book is merely a collection of random thoughts, basically grouped into chapters such as ""Prayer"" or ""Character"". Within each chapter are a few dozen little one or two sentence epithets. Some are as long as a paragraph. Most of them are profoundly un-inspiring. I would say only about half of them mention Christ. Some of them are worth remembering, thus the 2 star rating, but many of them are basically no more than this sort of thing (I paraphrase): ""You are lazy and foolish...when are you going to get it together and get on with your life?"" Or something cheerful like ""No matter how hard you try, you can still do more."" It reads like a bitter, barely literate ""Dao De Ching"", except that the Dao is much more inspiring, even though it isn't Christian. I read them and just scratched my head...was this guy serious? I think part of the problem may well be that they are poorly translated from Spanish. The English syntax is poor, the punctuation irregular, and often the meanings of many sentences are completely opaque. There are sentence fragments that leave you scratching your head. One of the epithets really stumped me. ""Are there no real men left? Why do we have nothing but...bellies?"" I didn't know what to make of that one. And I didn't know what to make of dozens of others. All in all the book left me feeling foolish and confused. I felt as though I was being yelled at by someone with a poor command of English.If his writing is anything to go by, I don't think Father Escriva was a terribly erudite man. It's quite easy to toss off a little book like this. With random disjointed thoughts, you don't need to even construct a decent paragraph, or develop an argument, or a complex point. You can just throw verbal cream pies at your reader. All of which gives me the funny feeling, at the back of my brain, that Opus Dei is really pretty weird after all. I do not intend to look further into joining them, nor do I intend to read any more of this man's writing. I don't doubt his sanctity. But with all the wonderful, uplifting Catholic writing out there (Aquinas, Augustine, etc.) why would I spend my time on an oddity like this? I don't see how you could start a movement like Opus Dei based on the thought contained in here, unless the movement really ISN'T based on the thought here but reather something else, which I fear may be the truth of the matter.",1

The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive,"Previously published as Ancient Science, Secret History contains 150 pages of new material. The Secret History of The World and How To Get Out Alive is the definitive book of the real answers where Truth is more fantastic than fiction. Laura Knight-Jadczyk, wife of internationally known theoretical physicist, Arkadiusz Jadczyk, an expert in hyperdimensional physics, draws on science and mysticism to pierce the veil of reality. With sparkling humour and wisdom, she picks up where Fulcanelli left off, sharing over thirty years of research to reveal, for the first time, The Great Work and the esoteric Science of the Ancients in terms accessible to scholar and layperson alike. Conspiracies have existed since the time of Cain and Abel. Facts of history have been altered to support the illusion. The question today is whether a sufficient number of people will see through the deceptions, thus creating a counter-force for positive change - the gold of humanity - during the upcoming times of Macro-Cosmic Quantum Shift. Laura argues convincingly, based on the revelations of the deepest of esoteric secrets, that the present is a time of potential transition, an extraordinary opportunity for individual and collective renewal: a quantum shift of awareness and perception which could see the birth of true creativity in the fields of science, art and spirituality. The Secret History of the World allows us to redefine our interpretation of the universe, history, and culture and to thereby navigate a path through this darkness. In this way, Laura Knight-Jadczyk shows us how we may extend the possibilities for all our different futures in literal terms. With over 800 pages of fascinating reading, The Secret History of The World and How to Get Out Alive is rapidly being acknowledged as a classic with profound implications for the destiny of the human race. With painstakingly researched facts and figures, the author overturns long-held conventional ideas on religion, philosophy, Grail legends, science, and alchemy, presenting a cohesive narrative pointing to the existence of an ancient techno-spirituality of the Golden Age which included a mastery of space and time: the Holy Grail, the Philosopher's Stone, the True Process of Ascension. Laura provides the evidence for the advanced level of scientific and metaphysical wisdom possessed by the greatest of lost ancient civilizations - a culture so advanced that none of the trappings of civilization as we know it were needed, explaining why there is no 'evidence' of civilization as we know it left to testify to its existence. The author's consummate synthesis reveals the Message in a Bottle reserved for humanity, including the Cosmology and Mysticism of mankind Before the Fall when, as the ancient texts tell us, man walked and talked with the gods. Laura shows us that the upcoming shift is that point in the vast cosmological cycle when mankind - or at least a portion of mankind - has the opportunity to regain his standing as The Child of the King in the Golden Age. If ever there was a book that can answer the questions of those who are seeking Truth in the spiritual wilderness of this world, then surely The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive is it.",['Laura Knight-Jadczyk'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=X3I_7Srgs1oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=X3I_7Srgs1oC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Secret+History+of+the+World+and+How+to+Get+Out+Alive&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,"Red Pill Press, Ltd",2005,http://books.google.com/books?id=X3I_7Srgs1oC&dq=The+Secret+History+of+the+World+and+How+to+Get+Out+Alive&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Antiquities'],3.0,0976504103,,A29M05HMJ8VA3W,Sam,98/134,1.0,1203033600,The author's own private hell... going public,"This is a review of the book, which is impossible to cover in it's entirety save for vague generalization due to it's mammoth size and diverse contents. In addition, I believe it's important for the reader to know where the ideas in the book come from and I would also like to share my experience as a dabbler in the author's world...I remember when I discovered the author's website (type ""cassiopaea"" into any search engine to find it), I was deeply in ""seeking"" mode and would leave no stone unturned, so naturally Laura's website, the ideas of which form the basis of this current book, intrigued me. I had read a few traditional (and confusing) Western Alchemy/Occult type books (or parts thereof) as well as a great deal of the sort of armchair philosophizing books that attempted to sort of ""bring it all together"" for the neophyte seeker. I'm talking about the standard sort of books any fledgling dabbler in the occult is bound to read first: stuff by Israel Regardie, Dion Fortune, Manly P. Hall, Gurdjieff, Franz Bardon, etc.At the point when I randomly came across the author's website I had come to appreciate something in Buddhism that I had not really found coherently expressed in the various other forms of mysticism/occult I had studied for the previous 10 years or so with all my sincere efforts. When I stumbled across this author's website, my mind tumbled into an abyss of total doubt and real spiraling ""out of control"" feeling, but I stuck with it. I read and entertained her beliefs honestly and open-mindedly until I really understood her reality. And it disturbed me to believe it was true. Then, one day, I woke up and realized something I had read by RA Wilson really applied here: ""what the thinker thinks, the prover proves."" This was a reality tunnel nobody has any way of proving or disproving... and it's completely negative, not unlike all the religions this author condemns as evil tools of manipulation! I would almost guess if I stuck with her ideas for too long, it would have caused some sort of psychotic break or something.Now, I personally believe in non-carbon-based life, as have some of our most brilliant scientists, such as Planck and Shrodinger (so I'm not a kook!), so when the author explains that she receives this information from a Ouija board, I don't discount her offhand as a nut-case. However, you should be aware that this is how she comes to a lot of her conclusions; she asks ""the Cassiopaeans"" about something and they give her answers on a Ouija board. She then mulls it all over and comes up with some truly terrifying ideas about reality. It took her a while to fully trust them and, actually, she's still not completely certain if she can trust what's coming out of her Ouija board because it could be misdirection coming from other entities, who naturally want to keep the author and everyone else trapped.In the author's eyes, pretty much everything is mind-control (and I don't disagree with her here). The problem, for me, is that what she presents as supposedly a fully-researched and presumably legitimate approach to the subject matter is anything but that. She certainly knows a lot of general and fragmentary information about a lot of subjects which she pieces together methodically and thoroughly-- not unlike David Icke, although I'm sure some will not appreciate that comparison. It took Icke several books of terrifying paranoia before he finally came to the conclusion Hindus had expressed far better a thousand years earlier: all is love... so what is with all the paranoia-inducing speculation and hearsay?)This author's conclusions (opinions) are basically all the result of sheltered personal interpretation, perhaps an overactive imagination and perhaps the ideas of those beings she might possibly channel through her Ouija board. Her opinions on various religions or mystery traditions are not those of one who has actively experienced them as a part of the community. Without any firsthand knowledge of many of these subjects, she tends to resort to conjecture. As a matter of fact, she HAS to resort to conjecture, unless she is depending on her supposed spirit guides... in which case, she is then resorting not simply to speculation, but also to hearsay.If it is true that the mind creates its own reality, it is not surprising that the author seems to be living in her own private hell, complete with death threats.",1

This is a kind of New Age chirping for people who prefer not to strain their brains excessively and to feel well with the least mental expense. How does one earn a reputation in these circles? Easy: by preaching ignorance to the ignorant.Here are a few examples that should serve as a caution to everyone who might otherwise be taken for a ride, as I surely was. If you are a Hegelian, at some point you must introduce the &#65533;Spirit&#65533;. Wilber does it pretty early by discussing evolution. The wing, according to him, is useful only when fully developed &#65533; a half-wing is no good. Such a sophisticated instrument could only have evolved with the help of a supreme agency. This is an argument from a Jehovah Witnesses tract: the real science points out that even a quarter-wing (as well as a quarter-eye) is usually better than none if it gives the animal the slightest edge over the wingless. And it does: somebody should have shown Wilber a flying squirrel.Introducing his theory of &#65533;holons&#65533; Wilber states that matter is infinitely divisible (and compounded). The real science, of course, has discovered otherwise: the string is the smallest element of matter.The discussion of the Big Bang and of what could have &#65533;preceded&#65533; it is altogether laughable. What is missing throughout the book is an awareness that every proposition is worthless unless provable.When mentioning the Axial Age with its saints and prophets, Wilber studiously omits every name connected with the Judeo-Christian tradition. One feels an agenda, but it is never stated explicitly. Sneaky.Last but not least: the whole book is written in the form of a dialog, but the only purpose of the questioner is to suck up to the answerer; he never advances any intelligent objection, never mentions any contrarian authority with the exception of some feminists. This must be the easiest way of philosophical discourse.I must confess that I picked up this book because its main thesis, the poverty of the reductionism, is close to my heart. But I would rather stay with the reductionists as long as they respect my intelligence.",1
House Atreides,"A prequel to Frank Herbert's science fiction novel, ""Dune,"" journeys back to the planet Arrakis to visit the extraordinary desert world decades before Paul Atreides arrives to change the history of the universe","['Brian Herbert', 'Kevin J.

Elizabeth Pietrzak ""driftingcloud""",98/130,2.0,1073347200,A Major Error Per Chapter,"Dune: House Atreides is the first in the expansions to the Dune legacy created by Frank Herbert, this novel is set approximately 45 years prior to the first Dune novel written in 1963. Written by Brian Herbert, the son of the author of Dune, with co-writer Kevin J. Anderson, the duo has huge footsteps in which to follow. The novel takes us through the lives of the young Leto Atreides the man who would soon be Duke Leto and father to Muad'Dib, Duncan Idaho and his escape from the Harkonnen slave pits, Baron Harkonnen's early dealings with the planet Arrakis and his subsequent siring of Lady Jessica, Shaddam Corrino and his ascendancy to the emperor's throne with the help of childhood friend Hasmir Fenring, Thufir Hawat, and the original planetologist assigned to Arrakis by the Emperor Elrood, Pardo Kynes.Now if that looks like a mouthful, even to a seasoned Dune fanatic, wait till you try to chew on all of the additional characters that these key players meet and interact with. It's enough to make your head spin. When you mash all of these plotlines together into one novel like this (and the first in a trilogy, so you know that the next two will be more of the same characters and certainly an equal number of new characters) you are left with a meal consisting of delicately sipping a vintage wine in between bites of chili-cheese fries. The chapters get shorter and shorter as the book progresses and end up more akin to a few frames of an after-school cartoon rather than something worth reading, pondering, digesting, and perhaps re-reading again someday. Nope. One read through on this book and you will probably need to brush your teeth just to get the bad taste out of your mouth.The entire Pardo Kynes story simply does not belong in this novel. It is little more than a fleshed out version of Appendix One from Dune, and Frank Herbert wrote a more compelling version in 6 or 7 pages than son Herbert and co-writer Anderson do with a dozen chapters. Pluck this plotline out of this book altogether and make it a smaller, separate book of its own. It's presence here shows us how little these two really know about storytelling.For those of us who have been Dune fanatics for any portion of the past 3-1/2 decades, we get to look forward do at least one major Duniverse error in each of these chapters, whether from the Baron's lean, muscular physique, to Duncan Idaho's curiously missing sister and absence of slave pits, to just about everyone and his brother being acquainted with the Bene Gesserit's breeding programs. Gone is the mystery of the Bene Gesserit, the origins of spice, and the inner workings of Ix. We even have Vladimir Harkonnen's suggested inclination toward boy sex toys (from Dune and Children of Dune) clearly laid out as no-holds-barred homosexuality. Makes you wonder how he is going to become the father of the future Jessica Atreides, hmmm? Well, never fear, but our wonderful Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohaim will find herself the future mother of Jessica through a surprising tryst with the Baron. OMG! Where did these boys miss the repeated references in the Dune chronicles to the multiple bastard children the Baron had by his reckless youthful adventures? The son Herbert insists that upon reading his father's notes, though, that the Baron is gay (not maybe even a little bi) and is forced to father this child (and another!) through a few weak plot points and manipulations. Wow! The imaginations of a pair of writers is limited by their extreme belief in polarities and simplicities. Every nuance is good/bad, straight/gay, obviously planned out and panned out.Every attempt at complexity can't escape the suffocating breath of complicated and contrived. If the reader wanted to scrutinize the text piece by piece, consider such timeless phrases as ""by the saints and sinners"" or ""the work of Satan"" or how about ""stronger than adamantium."" What, is this suddenly an X-Men novel?The inherent problem with any prequel, as clearly visible in the Star Wars prequels, is how to make use of the information that already exists in the later novels, and enhance it in the prequels, while not spelling out the details of what were surprises in the original series. If we know that Jessica is Baron Harkonnen's child, then where is the surprise upon reading Frank Herbert's Dune that the Baron is Paul's grandfather?Another problem with prequels, especially with decades between the actual writing of them, is to be careful not to introduce technology or advancements that would be inexplicably absent in the later novels or would give people an undue advantage if they were so readily available. Let's call into question these strange earplugs that Baron Harkonnen uses to make himself impervious to the Voice? You would think by the time of Dune, in relation to this book, that everyone in court would have such earplugs to avoid manipulation by the Bene Gesserit. Of course what follows is sure to upset the Bene Gesserit fans: A Reverend Mother is stunned by the future equivalent of a tazer and then she is raped! Let's not even consider that some strange disappearing no-ship technology wanders into the Baron's hands. This would become real useful to wipe out a pesky Duke who took over Arrakis. Come on! Reality check!This book feels more like a color by numbers painting that a child could easily do, rather than a complex and intriguing work of art. The authors are trying to connect too many dots into one story, and they are winking at the readers repeatedly as they try to be clever with tying in as many Dune themes as possible, even themes that will not resurface for 4500 years in Heretics of Dune or Chapterhouse Dune, or more frighteningly, in the ever-present Dune 7 and 8 looming on the horizon...This reader is afraid to continue on to the next book, House Harkonnen...",0

Orientalism,,,,,,,,,,B000NXMFOI,,A18CA0GRHDVP8X,Earl Hazell,98/124,4.0,1012435200,Arguably flawed but exceptionally potent and important,"Public opinion has gone in and out like the tides on Said's book since I first read it some six odd years ago. It has been said that the primal characteristic of a truly enlightened mind is its ability to entertain two seemingly contradictory ideas at the same time; in that context I find it odd that people can be so proud of their total discrediting of Said's work in favor of the preeminent and (seemingly) diametrically opposed Bernard Lewis. It is obvious to me that both men have something provocative to teach us about Europe and America's relationship with the Middle East (as it has been over the centuries and is reflected in culture and scholarship), and both need to be heard in that context.It is not often that a brilliantly, exhaustively researched book on an alternatingly controversial and trivialized subject can engender an emotional response of the magnitude with which this work does--which usually means that it is worth reading. In documenting the psychological architecture of the western mind and its perspective on the East--or the ""Orient""--he deconstructs it. The idea that it exists deconstructs it by nature; before reading this book you will swear that most of what we know of the Arabian East is the absolute truth, without even being aware that it's been either romanticized into impotence or isn't much of anything complimentary, let alone influential.I rate ORIENTALISM, for its effect on our psyche as Americans alone (regardless of race or assumed political leanings), as one of the most important books written in the last decades of the 20th century. The world looks the way it does not because of natural law, like the reasons why the Sahara has become a desert--or at least not by the natural laws we have imagined. Edward Said, regardless of the possibility of biases coming through his scholarship, regardless of the political realities he left out of his thesis, shows this in remarkable fashion to people--like myself--who never considered this fact's existence (let alone its influence on my perceptions of the Middle East in all their forms).Be mature enough to accept that it is not the only educated opinion or set of facts about our complex world, and this book will be a great read and teach a great deal. I would suggest triangulating ORIENTALISM with Karen Armstrong's HOLY WAR and Moseddeq Ahmed's WAR ON FREEDOM, for a truly eye-opening experience of the Western psyche regarding the East.",1
Good to Great,"The Challenge Built to Last, the defining management study of the nineties, showed how great companies triumph over time and how long-term sustained performance can be engineered into the DNA of an enterprise from the verybeginning. But what about the company that is not born with great DNA? How can good companies, mediocre companies, even bad companies achieve enduring greatness? The Study For years, this question preyed on the mind of Jim Collins. Are there companies that defy gravity and convert long-term mediocrity or worse into long-term superiority? And if so, what are the universal distinguishing characteristics that cause a company to go from good to great? The Standards Using tough benchmarks, Collins and his research team identified a set of elite companies that made the leap to great results and sustained those results for at least fifteen years. How great? After the leap, the good-to-great companies generated cumulative stock returns that beat the general stock market by an average of seven times in fifteen years, better than twice the results delivered by a composite index of the world's greatest companies, including Coca-Cola, Intel, General Electric, and Merck. The Comparisons The research team contrasted the good-to-great companies with a carefully selected set of comparison companies that failed to make the leap from good to great. What was different? Why did one set of companies become truly great performers while the other set remained only good? Over five years, the team analyzed the histories of all twenty-eight companies in the study. After sifting through mountains of data and thousands of pages of interviews, Collins and his crew discovered the key determinants of greatness -- why some companies make the leap and others don't. The Findings The findings of the Good to Great study will surprise many readers and shed light on virtually every area of management strategy and practice. The findings include: Level 5 Leaders: The research team was shocked to discover the type of leadership required to achieve greatness. The Hedgehog Concept (Simplicity within the Three Circles): To go from good to great requires transcending the curse of competence. A Culture of Discipline: When you combine a culture of discipline with an ethic of entrepreneurship, you get the magical alchemy of great results. Technology Accelerators: Good-to-great companies think differently about the role of technology. The Flywheel and the Doom Loop: Those who launch radical change programs and wrenching restructurings will almost certainly fail to make the leap. “Some of the key concepts discerned in the study,” comments Jim Collins, ""fly in the face of our modern business culture and will, quite frankly, upset some people.” Perhaps, but who can afford to ignore these findings?",['Jim Collins'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DDOmWaG4qtQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=DDOmWaG4qtQC&dq=Good+to+Great&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,HarperBusiness,2001,http://books.google.nl/books?id=DDOmWaG4qtQC&dq=Good+to+Great&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Business & Economics'],58.0,069452607X,26.95,A2227AG1YVVE7R,Business researcher,98/123,1.0,1137974400,Caveat Emptor--Let the buyer beware,"Dear Business Managers and CEOs:I am here to help you.

They--and the consultants they pay for advice--study the methods and tactics of successful companies in search of the magic formulas for business prosperity. What could make more sense?What could be more dangerous. Looking at successful firms can be remarkably misleading. I once listened to a presentation about the attributes of top entrepreneurs. Drawing on a wealth of impressive case studies, the speaker concluded that all of these leaders shared two key traits, which accounted for their success: They persisted, often despite initial failures, and they were able to persuade others to join them.That sounded reasonable enough to most people in the audience. The only trouble was, the speaker failed to point out that these selfsame traits are necessarily the hallmark of spectacularly unsuccessful entrepreneurs. Think about it: Incurring large losses requires both persistence in the face of failure and the ability to persuade others to pour their money down the drain.Here's the problem about learning by good example: Anyone who tries to make generalizations about business success by studying existing companies or managers falls into the classic statistical trap of selection bias- that is, of relying on samples that are not representative of the whole population they're studying. So if business researchers study only successful companies, any relationships they infer between management practice and success will be necessarily misleading.The theoretically correct way to discover what makes a business successful is to look at both thriving and floundering companies. Then business researchers will correctly identify the qualities that separate the successes from the failures. Researchers might conclude- as many have--that the strength of a company's culture is associated with success because many successful companies have strong cultures. But if they were to study bankrupt companies as well, they might find that many of those also had strong cultures. They might then be moved to hypothesize that the nature of a company's culture is at least as important as its intensity and then look more deeply into the whole issue of culture.Similarly, if we want to examine effective leadership traits, we cannot look only at excellent managers. We must also consider managers who failed to be promoted, were demoted, or were fired. Perhaps their styles of leadership were equally visionary- or humble. Without looking, we cannot tell.Denrell continues . . .Cautionary words and counsels of failure, I know, are seldom well received. Managers crave certainties and role models from business literature, and to some extent they have to. They live in a fast-paced world, and they often cannot afford to postpone action until they get better data. But there really is no excuse for ignoring the glaring traps we've described in these pages. Success may be more inspirational, but the inescapable logic of statistics dictates that managers in pursuit of high performance are more likely to attain their goal if they give the stories of their competitors' failures as full a hearing as they currently do the stories of their successes.So, buy this book at your own risk. In fact, I hope you realize that it is better not to buy it.",1
The Non-Designer's Type Book,"A lot has happened in the world of digital design since the first edition of this title was published, but one thing remains true: There is an ever-growing number of people attempting to design everything from newsletters to advertisements with no formal training. This book is the one place they can turn to find quick, non-intimidating, excellent design help from trusted design instructor Robin Williams. This revised and expanded classic includes a new chapter on designing with type, more quizzes and exercises, updated projects, and new visual and typographic examples that give the book a fresh, modern look. In The Non-Designer's Design Book, 4th Edition, Robin turns her attention to the basic principles that govern good design. Perfect for beginners, Robin boils great design into four easy-to-master principles: contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity (C.R.A.P.!). Readers who follow her clearly explained concepts will produce more sophisticated and professional work immediately. Humor-infused, jargon-free prose interspersed with design exercises, quizzes, and illustrations make learning a snap–which is just what audiences have come to expect from this bestselling author.",['Robin Williams'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pqHfBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=pqHfBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Non-Designer%27s+Type+Book&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Pearson Education,2015,http://books.google.com/books?id=pqHfBQAAQBAJ&dq=The+Non-Designer%27s+Type+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Art'],13.0,0201353679,,A1DQG4COP3AI95,M. Mantis,98/123,1.0,1070928000,NOT for type lovers,"When I picked up this book, I figured that the title, &quot;The Non-Designer's Type Book,&quot; meant that it was a book about type, FOR non-designers. After reading it, from cover to cover, I now wonder if the title refers to the author's credentials rather than the book's target audience. I love typography. I sit in theaters and watch every minute of the rolling credits if the font used is well chosen and well displayed. I have a Caslon 540 lower-case &quot;g&quot; pinned to the wall above my Mac instead of swimsuit pics. If you love type, you know what I'm talking about. If you love type, avoid this book and do not recommend it to anyone who hopes to someday love typography and master its use. Robin Williams' cutesy and heavy-handed text, while sometimes informative, is loaded with irritating &quot;insights&quot; as well as written-in-stone directives that are passed off as law. For instance, in at least two places, she states that type should NEVER, EVER be underlined. She says that it's a &quot;law&quot; that should &quot;never&quot; be broken. C'mon Robin! I mean yes, underlining is very often misused, but have you looked at the latest PRINT or CA Annual? There is a time and a place for underlining and the sensitive, savvy designer knows when and how to do it. She outright trashes one of the most elegantly designed faces in the history of the printed word, Helvetica, and glibly states that it will be out of style for the &quot;next two hundred years.&quot; What?? Again, has Ms. Williams even looked at what contemporary (and effective) designers are doing these days? Helvetica is alive and flourishing. And, at the same time she is trashing Helvetica, she calls &quot;rendered&quot; type (such as 3D effects, letters that appear to be chiseled from stone or made of, say, salad greens) typography's &quot;most beautiful&quot; trend. She's killin' me!! If you want to fulfill and expand your appreciation for typography, buy Robert Bringhurst's exquisite manual, The Elements of Typographic Style.",0
Blinded by the Right: The Conscience of an Ex-Conservative,"In a powerful and deeply personal memoir David Brock, the original right-wing scandal reporter, chronicles his rise to the pinnacle of the conservative movement and his painful break with it. David Brock pilloried Anita Hill in a bestseller. His reporting in The American Spectator as part of the infamous “Arkansas Project” triggered the course of events that led to the historic impeachment trial of President Clinton. Brock was at the center of the right-wing dirty tricks operation of the Gingrich era—and a true believer—until he could no longer deny that the political force he was advancing was built on little more than lies, hate, and hypocrisy. In Blinded By the Right, Brock, who came out of the closet at the height of his conservative renown, tells his riveting story from the beginning, giving us the first insider’s view of what Hillary Rodham Clinton called “the vast right-wing conspiracy.” Whether dealing with the right-wing press, the richly endowed think tanks, Republican political operatives, or the Paula Jones case, Brock names names from Clarence Thomas on down, uncovers hidden links, and demonstrates how the Republican Right’s zeal for power created the poisonous political climate that culminated in George W. Bush’s election. With a new afterword by the author, Blinded By the Right is a classic political memoir of our times.",['David Brock'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CZIzw4qk1x0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=CZIzw4qk1x0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Blinded+by+the+Right:+The+Conscience+of+an+Ex-Conservative&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Crown,2002-04-24,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CZIzw4qk1x0C&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],5.0,0812930991,,,,98/121,5.0,1015718400,"Ah, well, finally....the truth","This is not an easy book to read: the paragraphs are long,and there is no character assassination--just plain honesttruth, and man, is it scary.

Democracy Matters: Winning the Fight Against Imperialism,"“Uncompromising and unconventional . . . Cornel West is an eloquent prophet with attitude.” —Newsweek“ West reveals himself as a thinker of dazzling erudition, whose critiques are inevitably balanced by an infectious optimism and magnanimity of spirit.” —The Village Voice In his major bestseller, Race Matters, philosopher Cornel West burst onto the national scene with his searing analysis of the scars of racism in American democracy. Race Matters has become a contemporary classic, still in print after ten years, having sold more than four hundred thousand copies. A mesmerizing speaker with a host of fervidly devoted fans, West gives as many as one hundred public lectures a year and appears regularly on radio and television. Praised by The New York Times for his ""ferocious moral vision"" and hailed by Newsweek as ""an elegant prophet with attitude,"" he bridges the gap between black and white opinion about the country's problems. In Democracy Matters, West returns to the analysis of the arrested development of democracy-both in America and in the crisis-ridden Middle East. In a strikingly original diagnosis, he argues that if America is to become a better steward of democratization around the world, we must first wake up to the long history of imperialist corruption that has plagued our own democracy. Both our failure to foster peace in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the crisis of Islamist anti-Americanism stem largely from hypocrisies in our dealings with the world. Racism and imperial expansionism have gone hand in hand in our country's inexorable drive toward hegemony, and our current militarism is only the latest expression of that drive. Even as we are shocked by Islamic fundamentalism, our own brand of fundamentalism, which West dubs Constantinian Christianity, has joined forces with imperialist corporate and political elites in an unholy alliance, and four decades after the murder of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., insidious racism still inflicts debilitating psychic pain on so many of our citizens. But there is a deep democratic tradition in America of impassioned commitment to the fight against imperialist corruptions-the last great expression of which was the civil rights movement led by Dr. King-and West brings forth the powerful voices of that great democratizing tradition in a brilliant and deeply moving call for the revival of our better democratic nature. His impassioned and provocative argument for the revitalization of America's democracy will reshape the terms of the raging national debate about America's role in today's troubled world.",['Cornel West'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZYNzIa9OyQEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=ZYNzIa9OyQEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Democracy+Matters:+Winning+the+Fight+Against+Imperialism&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin,2005-08-30,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZYNzIa9OyQEC&source=gbs_api,['Political Science'],2.0,B000PGTF0A,,A8C0PUD6C1KP8,Bryan C.

With the talking heads on FOX and CNN and the dribble that drips from the mouth of the Bush administration (and often the Kerry campaign), West argues that America has lost its ability to advance democratically. This is an important book for anyone who wishes to transcend the easy labels of the day and stop the shallow mudslinging so common in our time. Whether you agree with Professor West's conclusions, the overall point of his work is to have a meaningful dialogue about the state of our country that does not devolve into the mindless shouting so common today.The comments by some envoking the impoverished mark of ""Leftist"" prove Dr. West's point: the dogmatic inflexibility of much of this nation has made a mockery of our political process. If conservatives and liberals alike would read this book with an open mind, instead of questioning why dissenters don't leave this great country, we would all be better off.",1

Gareth’s sole bequest is an old family diary, which may or may not contain the secrets of his past . . . and the key to his future. The problem is—it’s written in Italian, of which Gareth speaks not a word. Meet Our Heroine . . . All the ton agreed: there was no one quite like Hyacinth Bridgerton.

But rest assured, he’s spinning in his grave when Gareth and Hyacinth cross paths at the annual—and annually discordant—Smythe-Smith musicale. To Hyacinth, Gareth’s every word seems a dare, and she offers to translate his diary, even though her Italian is slightly less than perfect.

The ONLY guy for her is the hero..yet we wonder if even SHE isn't sure about him--that she has to hold onto this guy as she has already let too many fish get away.2) Hyacynth is not especially likable--and part of it is JQ TELLS us she is this or that but she does little to SHOW us Hy's attributes. We are constantly reminded that she is smarter than most men and that she is very clever. Yet, when it comes down to it... she seems to have no real personality of her own. Show us how she is clever and diabolical...please. Hy seems more like a character out of Mean Girls than a heroine that we could AND should relate to. IE at the Smythe-Smith concert..it is more of a joke..vs Penelope who had gone because she FELT for these poor talentless women. Hy seems almost smug in her knowledge that she is a Bridgerton and everyone will be beholden to her because of this..vs someone who is more of an individual....and people want to be with her because of HER. Thus, there is not a lot about her to like.I have found that there was more character developement in JQ's short stories than what was displayed in this book. Readers need to FEEL something for the heroine and sadly, we felt zero.3) I admire Julia Quinn for trying something new--and in this case, a mystery, but I never found myself waiting for the big reveal. No suspense. No surprise. Again, each character knows a secret that they are keeping from the other..but there is NO feeling! VERY unsatisfactory. In fact, had this been resolved in a satisfactory fashion, I may have a TOTALLY different rating. But the way this book ends really reveals how little the mystery really meant to the story. YET this WAS a romantic mystery...yet there was no romance nor any mystery. Bleh. I just hope this is Julia's last mystery. Or, she needs to read some Agatha Christie before she attempts another. And the last page of the book reveals how little this mystery really had to do with this story.4) The first sex scene is really..shall I use the word...unnecessary?? Ok the motivations of Gareth to 'bed' her is REALLY weak..and thus it just seems that JQ put that scene in there because 2/3rds of the book went by and there had not been any sort of sex scene. Gratitious. :(5) The Bridgerton clan is more of a guest appearance...and tired at best. Gregory does not seem more than remotely interesting--and he is the last book. He just seems REALLY dull. :( And Anthony! UGH! Just ruined the Viscount that Loved Me for me...What I really wonder is why Anthony is written the way he is..when he married a far more difficult woman than Hy..a woman who was not afraid to speak her mind when she had too many years on the shelf and was outspoken as all get out--without any sort of fortune or grand family name behind her. There is no way that after living with Kate all of these years that Anthony would have handled Hy the way he did....6) Gareth's parentage. I think that having something similar (two brothers/like brothers) two books in a row was not the freshest idea...and this goes back to my rushed idea. I don't have the eww factor that others have..but more that this seems that the writer is out of any sort of fresh ideas.7) While I am at it, I am pushing for JQ to do a book on Violet's story. Yea, we know it ends sadly, but like Star wars Episode three, we know the outcome, we just want to know how she go there!",0

The One-straw revolution: An introduction to natural farming,"Call it “Zen and the Art of Farming” or a “Little Green Book,” Masanobu Fukuoka’s manifesto about farming, eating, and the limits of human knowledge presents a radical challenge to the global systems we rely on for our food. At the same time, it is a spiritual memoir of a man whose innovative system of cultivating the earth reflects a deep faith in the wholeness and balance of the natural world. As Wendell Berry writes in his preface, the book “is valuable to us because it is at once practical and philosophical. It is an inspiring, necessary book about agriculture because it is not just about agriculture.” Trained as a scientist, Fukuoka rejected both modern agribusiness and centuries of agricultural practice, deciding instead that the best forms of cultivation mirror nature’s own laws. Over the next three decades he perfected his so-called “do-nothing” technique: commonsense, sustainable practices that all but eliminate the use of pesticides, fertilizer, tillage, and perhaps most significantly, wasteful effort. Whether you’re a guerrilla gardener or a kitchen gardener, dedicated to slow food or simply looking to live a healthier life, you will find something here—you may even be moved to start a revolution of your own.",['Masanobu Fukuoka'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3Uo1tTcpDmkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=3Uo1tTcpDmkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+One-straw+revolution:+An+introduction+to+natural+farming&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,New York Review of Books,2010-09-08,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3Uo1tTcpDmkC&source=gbs_api,['Nature'],16.0,B0006EYTF2,,A1F55DQ08OWIDP,Harold A. Roth,98/119,2.0,1254873600,This is not the future of sustainable food,"I've been meaning to read this book for a long time. Maybe if I'd read when I was first starting out in organic gardening or became interested in sustainable food production, I would have been as taken with it as the huge number of ""absolutely fabulous"" reviewers apparently are. The thing is that I came to this book after 25+ years of organic gardening and years of trying various methods of growing various plants sustainably, so pragmatism is coloring my review.The methods outlined in this book will not be helpful to most people trying to grow food sustainably in North America. I am not talking about the rejection of chemical ferts and pesticides. I am there with him on that totally. I'm not talking about his focus on growing small, either--he discusses growing food sufficient for a family on 1/4 acre, but he is limiting it to grains (he grows veggies in a large citrus orchard). I am talking about the use of nothing but hand tools, the use of straw as a mulch, the focus on growing three grain crops which depend on a frost-free winter, and the use of flooding for irrigation. I think anyone who has made even a stab at growing food in North America on a small scale can see the problems with this. So there's that.There's also the problem of Mr. Fukuoka's unpaid help. I think it is great for people to go and learn from someone like him, but they work for no pay and live in unheated huts without electricity or running water. In terms of practicality, how many of us are going to have help like that? People seem to not notice this.Finally, I found Mr. Fukuoka's philosophy of nothing means anything and nothing human beings do makes any difference in the grand scheme of things to be despressing in the extreme.The central idea--that you can grow sufficient food sustainably in a small plot--makes sense to me, although in my opinion we have not yet arrived at models that are truly flexible and workable. But outside of that idea, this book's value is mostly in the depiction of one guy's struggle to make people think differently about agriculture in Japan.",1
Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health,,['L.

This one is about 100 pages long. This glossary is supposed to help you with words you might not know. However, in the text itself, there is no indication of whether a word is defined in the glossary or not.In short, you will probably find yourself flipping back to the glossary pretty often. Not a fun way of reading.What's even more ridiculous is that the glossary, while it does contain some difficult words, also contains such everyday terms as ""ball"", ""fair"" and ""wisdom teeth"".Now here's an interesting fact: The SYNOPSIS is only 11 pages. In those 11 pages are ~78 words that can be found in the glossary, an average of 7 words a page! Of those 78 words, 16 of them were Dianetic terms, averaging one new Dianetic word a page.Turn the pages a few more times and you come to a section titled HOW TO READ THIS BOOK. Makes you feel small and stupid, doesn't it?INTERESTING THOUGHTSThere are many interesting thoughts in this book. How survival is what motivates all living things. How your engrams can control you if they become restimulated. Why talking around the ""unconscious"" is dangerous. How the ability to remember everything relates to sanity.Dianetics is interested in getting rid of these engrams (moments of ""unconsciousness"") and supposedly by getting rid of them your whole body benefits and you'll probably even get a boost in IQ.One must keep in mind that this book was written in 1950, so some of Hubbard's analogies are not as good as they could be. For myself, it seemed like he was saying that the human mind is a FRAGMENTED HARDDRIVE (like on your Windows PC at home).Engrams are the fragments, scattered here and there. And just like your PC at home, a fragmented mind is not operating at full capacity.By following Dianetic therapy with an auditor, you are essentially DEFRAGMENTING your mind.As I found out, this is actually a very good analogy, as the founder of Executive Software/Diskeeper Corporation is Craig Jensen, a Scientologist. What does this company make. Diskeeper, a harddrive defragmenting tool!Defragmenting your mind sounds pretty interesting, doesn't it? There's just one problem . . .SCIENTIFIC FACTSAs I read this book, I noticed that LRH was fond of the following phrase ""It is a scientific fact"". At last count, I noted ~23 uses of ""scientific fact"" in the whole book.First off, I think one has to understand what LRH's definition of a ""scientific fact"" is. The answer lies on page 157, halfway down the page . . .""The only test is whether or not a fact works. If it does work and can be used, it is a scientific fact.""What's missing here is that his ""scientific facts"" apparently don't have to be OBSERVABLE or DOCUMENTED. As you read this book, how many X-Rays do you see comparing the mind of a Preclear with that of a Clear?ZERO.How many photocopies of case histories of past auditing sessions do you find in this book?ZERO.How do you prove with physical, tangible evidence that engrams exist?I have no idea . . .And for me, that's why Dianetics falls flat on its face. This book has some interesting ideas (ideas that may even be partially or entirely correct!), but without any hard evidence it's hard to see how anyone can take the bait.THE MYSTERYLike I said at the beginning of my review, I'm not here to talk about Xenu or the other common attacks on Scientology. However, any average person would probably ask the following question about something that is in the glossary zero times and in the index zero times . . .What is up with the VOLCANO on the cover of the book and what does it have to do with Dianetics (besides being pretty cool cover art)???If your copy of the Holy Bible had a picture of a box of Kleenex on the cover, wouldn't you wonder how it relates to Christianity?If your copy of the Quran had a picture of a Walruss on the cover, wouldn't you wonder how it ties in?Like LRH's ""scientific facts"" there are some things that are just not explained, and to me, that's creepy.",1

Chalk my previous thoughts up to newbie ignorance, I guess. Also, in the interest of full disclosure: I am no longer in real estate, after spending two years trying in earnest, but ultimately giving up (having burned through all of my savings and maximized my personal debt). Do I blame this book for my failure? Of course not! It's not that simple (Note that the reviewer who said this didn't attack my arguments, but merely impugned my character).All that having been said, this book is worthless, for a number of reasons.First off, he repeats the tired maxim that it takes 99 ""No's"" to get to one ""Yes."" So, the key to success, then, is that you've got to resign yourself to simply slogging through those 99 No's in some fashion. Ferry's primary recommendation is ""cold doors,"" meaning walking a neighborhood, knocking on people's doors and asking them if they are planning on selling their home any time soon. He's serious about this! I took him up on his recommendation... in August... in Phoenix... it was not fun. All I got for my 100 ""No's"" was a lot of sweaty clothing.A moment's critical thought will expose one aspect of the sheer idiocy of this recommendation: Assuming the 99/1 ratio is absolute gospel, how long do you think it will take you to knock on enough doors to speak with 100 people (if no one answers it doesn't count toward the ratio)? Best case, I found, was 8 hours. In that same period of time you could use the phone and speak to several times more people. Shouldn't efficiency count for something when you're ""running a business""? (I agree with the other reviewer who said that this book describes making a ""job"" for yourself.)So, what about ""cold calling,"" then? Ferry doesn't endorse cold calling 100%, because it's not ""face to face"", but he doesn't discount it, really, either. He grudgingly admits that his readers are going to prefer it over cold doors. Unfortunately, with the new telemarketing laws, any realtor making cold calls is playing with fire. But even if we were to take his advice at the time it was given, it's absurd. Do you really think it's reasonable to believe that 1 out of 100 strangers you call is going to say to you ""Yes, I'm glad you called! I'm planning on selling my house in the next month or two. Come on over!"" I don't, either! (Don't think I didn't try this, however, because I did! ""Skeptical"" is not the same thing as ""close-minded"") But that's what Mike Ferry wants you to believe. Mike Ferry seems to want you to forget that real estate is a business about _relationships_.Let's assume for a moment that you're the world's greatest salesperson. People just can't say ""no"" to your flawless pitch and your irresistible charm. Okay, Ferry advises us that roughly 3 to 4 hours of our days as Realtors needs to be spent prospecting for new business--cold doors or cold calls. Think about that for a minute: You're making 6 figures a year (according to the title of this book), which means that, at minimum, your hourly wage is $48. Do you know _any_ telemarketers who make that kind of money? Obviously it would make a lot more sense for you to hire a high school kid part time and pay him or her $10/hour to do it for you (with a little training from you, the master salesperson, of course). Does Ferry recommend this? No. The fact that he doesn't point out something so obvious is cause for concern, in my view.So, Ferry recommends, in effect, that you spend the equivalent of $960+ per week (the value of your time) making cold calls. Why is it that he doesn't simply recommend setting up an aggressive advertising campaign with that roughly $4000/month? Not only would that be one massive campaign, but it would free up your time for other things. AND, people will call YOU (or your assistant) instead of you calling them--people who are actually interested in buying or selling real estate! Imagine that!*Did you get into real estate to make cold calls for 3 hours a day (in the evenings, no less, since that's when people are home. UGH!), to harass and manipulate hostile FSBOs and expired listings, or to have free time and low stress?Ferry also recommends against a geographic ""farm"" area, suggesting instead that you create a ""people farm"". I suppose there's nothing inherently wrong with this, except that farming a particular area has a number of distinct advantages: 1) You can become an expert on the area's trends and values; 2) You won't have to resign yourself to driving all over town to chase down that next listing; 3) It's much easier to set up targeted advertising, to maximize the effectiveness of your advertising dollar. None of those things are discussed in his book.Another item conspicuous by its absence is any discussion of how to best determine the necessary size of your farm based on your goal income. It's a simple formula; something that any new realtor would find extremely educational and useful... nowhere to be found in the book. (Hint: You need to determine average home values for the neighborhood, yearly average turnover rates, your likely market share...)Yet another of this book's oversights is any discussion of the indispensable referral network that all realtors must cultivate--that ""relationship"" thing again. Without exception, every realtor I spoke with who had been around for 5+ years told me that the bulk of their business volume came from referrals and repeat customers. Mike Ferry barely touches on this subject--probably because he knows his target audience is newbie realtors who won't have a referral base, yet. Nonetheless, I don't think that excuses leaving the subject out--especially given the title of the book!What you do get a lot of in this book--aside from the bogus platitudes--is sleazy, manipulative sales tactics that would make your neighborhood used car salesman blush. I am sorry that I ever recommended this book.Oh, one last thing--I want to speak to Donald Mitchell's asinine review above. His statements ""Once you have a lot of sales/listings... etc."" remind me of an old Steve Martin joke: ""You can be a millionaire and never pay taxes! ... First, get a million dollars..."" Hilarious, but certainly not helpful advice.*Hint: a well-designed advertising campaign that focuses on your ""positioning"" [see the book by the same name] and doesn't turn you into a commodity--like those awful ""Homes"" magazine ads do--is probably the ""best"" way to grow a successful real estate business. I encourage you to do a Google search for ""personal marketing"".",0

I'm a very happy grad student who enthusiastically pursues qualitative methods (and in fact teaches them to his undergrad students), but who learned at great expense to avoid this book at all costs.A large number of professors teaching research have latched onto Patton as the qualitative guru for valid reasons. He has done seminal work in the field, championed the process for decades, and is deservedly well respected for these efforts. The problem is using his book as a classroom textbook.This book is OK as a reference source, but the man is not a textbook author. The book is extremely difficult to comprehend, has not been revised significantly since the first edition in 1980, wanders off on tangents seldom related to the content (try the start of Chapter 5 if you need an example), fails to provide groundedness with adequate theoretical applications, and so on. ....I do use this book and quote from it when appropriate, but cannot recommend it as a textbook.",0

Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed),"A literary sensation and runaway bestseller, this brilliant debut novel tells with seamless authenticity and exquisite lyricism the true confessions of one of Japan's most celebrated geisha. Nominated as one of America’s best-loved novels by PBS’s The Great American Read Speaking to us with the wisdom of age and in a voice at once haunting and startlingly immediate, Nitta Sayuri tells the story of her life as a geisha. It begins in a poor fishing village in 1929, when, as a nine-year-old girl with unusual blue-gray eyes, she is taken from her home and sold into slavery to a renowned geisha house. We witness her transformation as she learns the rigorous arts of the geisha: dance and music; wearing kimono, elaborate makeup, and hair; pouring sake to reveal just a touch of inner wrist; competing with a jealous rival for men's solicitude and the money that goes with it. In Memoirs of a Geisha, we enter a world where appearances are paramount; where a girl's virginity is auctioned to the highest bidder; where women are trained to beguile the most powerful men; and where love is scorned as illusion. It is a unique and triumphant work of fiction—at once romantic, erotic, suspenseful—and completely unforgettable.",['Arthur Golden'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SOM54qQ6BgkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=SOM54qQ6BgkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Memoirs+of+a+Geisha+(Signed)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Vintage,1999-11-09,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SOM54qQ6BgkC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],1631.0,B000HJNEYS,,A2EL8QDYV6ZGIJ,Christina B.

It tells the story of a young girl sold into geisha training in Japan. I had no idea how much of an art form geisha was in this pre-WWII setting Gion and it was very interesting to learn so much more about it through the eyes of a young girl caught up in it. Sayuri is a wonderfully drawn character with a wide range of emotions as she endures cruelty, jealousy, misery and a whole new way of life and comes to accept it, excel in it and even embrace it. Particularly intriguing are the questions and conflicts raised by the novel about destiny, love, survival and tradition. The movie is coming out in December so I highly recommend reading it now.",1
Mexifornia: A State of Becoming,"Part history, part political analysis, and part memoir, Mexifornia is an intensely personal work by one of our most important writers. Victor Davis Hanson, known for his military histories and his social commentary, is a fifth-generation Californian who lives on a family farm in the Central Valley and has written eloquent elegies on the decline of agrarianism, Fields Without Dreams and The Land Was Everything. Here too, he ponders what has changed in California over the past quarter century, examining how the state and the Southwest more broadly—indeed, the entire nation—have been altered by hemorrhaging borders. Hanson admires the ambition and vigor of immigrants who have helped make California strong, but he indicts the disordered immigration policies that led to the present mess. He also illuminates the ways those policies are harmful to people who have come from Mexico and Central America seeking a better life in the United States. Nearly twenty years after the first publication of Mexifornia, Hanson offers an update on the continuing tragedy of illegal immigration. At the same time, he remains hopeful that our traditions of integration, assimilation, and intermarriage may yet remedy a predicament created by politicians and ideologues.",['Victor Davis Hanson'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=g7nrDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=g7nrDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Mexifornia:+A+State+of+Becoming&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Encounter Books,2021-07-13,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=g7nrDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Social Science'],2.0,1893554732,,A1YQLMUURMRS2C,Catherine A.

From the hoplites of ancient Greece, the farming crisis of the 80's, the history of warfare and culture, the teaching of the classics and now this searching analysis of the debacle of our non-policy on immigration, I have been astonished at how skillfully this man writes and with what intelligence he cuts to the essence of whatever subject he addresses. In the present book Hanson turns his gaze to a subject he is personally familiar with: the transformation of his native California by massive illegal immigration from Mexico. Hanson is not anti-Mexican. He has several Mexican relatives, his daughters are dating Mexican-Americans and most of the people he grew up with are Mexican-American or Mexican. What Hanson is opposed to is our feckless non-policy on immigration which allows steady waves of illegals to flood our border states and does not give us time to allow us to assimilate the Mexican immigrants here. Hanson believes strongly that the vast majority of immigrants, given time and opportunity, will assimilate and become good citizens. However it is impossible for this to be accomplished unless we gain control of our southern border and curb most illegal immigration. A timely book on a major issue that both the Republican and Democrat parties steadfastly ignore.",1

Certainly what I have learnt in my training I have NEVER seen in any book. For me KM was nothing new. It was a good read and interesting and gave me an insight into the psychology and social history behind its development. Maybe I should write a book &#65533; seriously, maybe I will.Kjetil Moland you asked what techniques I advocate against guns, knives and sticks &#65533; I recommend techniques similar to Krav Maga &#65533; but when I saw the KM techniques I picked them apart, I forget that what I know is not widely practised. I made specific points in my other review. THERE ARE SHORTCOMINGS IN THE TECHNIQUES IN THE KRAV MAGA BOOK. If you can&#65533;t pick up on them then you need more experience. Coat your practise knife in paint and see where you get cut. Karate, Taekwondo, Ju Jitsu, Judo, kickboxing, thaiboxing are inferior to KM for real world self defense (although Ju Jitsu should not have been too bad) they all have their own strengths but in all that I have seen of those you mentioned I have never seen adequate real world techniques taught. 4 of those you mentioned are purely sport and the other 2 are a combination of sport / traditions and none of them strictly taught without any pure real-world self defense practise are adequate for the real world &#65533; you should know that.p24 Stab to the Stomach from the Side, Oriental Hold, Forearm defense. Anyone skilled with a knife will immediately twist with the knife and slash the veins along your forearm, retreating and driving the blade down into your throat. Even if the attacker has no knife skills and just lunges at your stomach, you would be lucky if the knife was short enough to not hit you regardless. Either way you have put yourself in the path of the blade. Do you honestly believe that after blocking with your right forearm you are able to then move your right arm and grab the same position on the attackers wrist with your left hand while he stands there not moving? He has a huge knife, any movement he makes with his arm is leveraged with the length of the blade. Slash your forearm, hook it up into your armpit or bicep, not to mention your throat, the knife wielding attacker has the advantage of reach speed and leverage (not to mention the sharp edge) and the KM guy is basically saying &#65533;don&#65533;t stab my gut, stab my throat instead&#65533;.You would be far better off initially trapping the arm by deflecting it to your right, leaving you on the outside of the attacker (on his right hand side past his arm) and able to break his arm at the elbow or drive him down.However after criticising that technique I will say this: what they show IS instinctive, simple, easy to apply even in for example a really crowded place with people all around, easy to learn, and most importantly could well save you especially if the person attacking you is just some ordinary guy with a knife trying to stab you, and not a trained killer (with a cool head, knife skills and a deliberate intent). More likely than not, if you practise these KM skills, then in that situation your trained reflexes will save you and give you the edge over the attacker (the last thing he would expect is a competant counter attack).Also I would point out that many martial arts, if you had learnt them instead of KM, you would have the reflexes to block the initial stab but you probably would not instinctively grab the knife etc... like KM would teach you. The traditional martial arts generally do not give adequate training for real world events. KM does fill the gap quite a bit. I am sorry if I seemed overly critical before but remember I didn&#65533;t look at KM and think &#65533;gee I never saw this before&#65533;If you do not think you can defend yourself against knives, guns, sticks (or grenades &#65533; something I hope I never encounter) then you would probably learn a great deal from this book &#65533; and then you must practise it a lot as realistically as you can. Get it, get a friend, practise practise practise &#65533; experience is the real key. Practise until it is second nature and then practise some more but with chaotic unpredictable opponents (not just rehearsing) (like the reviewer who mentioned going all-out with pads). Tell your partner: &quot;Take this knife and kill me or die.&quot;Dip the practice knife in paint. Use a water pistol with food dye in it. Make no excuses. And don&#65533;t go thinking KM is the be all end all just because you&#65533;ve never seen techniques like these before. Everyone loves to think their martial art is the best and to pretend to themselves that because their technique is superior they will be OK &#65533; don&#65533;t fall in that trap, practise, learn what is useful and what works.Good luck and may you never have to use these skills.I also recommend &#65533;Bouncers Guide to Barroom Brawling&#65533; - an accurate account of street fighting, however it does not have many illustration or specific techniques like Krav Maga does.",1

Being quite liberal, I had to put it down and go outside for some fresh air, but it was rather hard to find a stopping point in order to do that.This is a very well-written book. As much as I disagreed with its message, the pages kept turning. It involves elements of the author's idealism, a hero who will do anything that he thinks is right, action, warring factions, government opression, and so many other addictive written elements such as love and love lost, martyrdom, etc.The particular type of idealism is disturbing; Turner, the hero of the book, is a White racist who, with his fellows, aspires to end all other races-- including Jews, who are portrayed in this book as evil-- for the ""protection"" of caucasians everywhere. The author sets his stage in a world where the ""good guys"" are kept down by a Jewish government who wants their guns. Throughout the book he goes from persecuted status to persecuted status until members of the Organization (the White Racialist group of which Turner is a member) revolt. The book portrays White racists as heroes and everyone else as either inconsequential or downright evil, including Whites not affiliated with the Organization. Despite its message, however, it is still well-written and hard to put down. Its nature, disturbing to most, will only make the storyline stick better in your head. I strongly recommend this book to someone who is not easily affected or easily sickened, and someone who is not sitting on a fence. There are graphic parts, disturbing parts, and times when you will put down the book and feel like someone has punched you in the chest, but anyone who enjoyed the movie ""American History X"" and/or has a fascination with the nature of hate should read this book.",0

Love, too, is foreign to the citizens of Oran. They marry and have children but the concept of love for love's sake is unknown to them. Their very inauthenticity and narrow views make them prime targets for the plague and when confronted with it, they have precious few resources for dealing with the calamities it presents.The greatest piece of foreshadowing, however, and the one that sets the book's theme is the sense of alienation and entrapment.

Freedom, truth and beauty all lie within a stone's throw, but, until the plague forces them to look, the Oranians remain blind to the beauties of the world outside.The message of Oran is as clear as the sea that sparkles within reach of its walls.

Get to Work: A Manifesto for Women of the World,"An outspoken, controversial study argues that in order to live up to their potential and feel fulfilled, women need to remain in the workplace rather than stay at home with their children.

But the author never claims to present a ""balanced"" view of the work/home dilemma that many middle-class and privileged women face. (BIG HINT: the subtitle of her book includes the word ""manifesto""! It's printed very cleverly as a ""little red book!"" Get it?)This book is a polemic, not a sociological or historical analysis of the work/home issue like Judith Warner's _Perfect Madness_. _Get to Work_ challenges women and men to ask themselves the classic philosophical question, ""what makes for a good life?"" and challenges them to defend their choices, understanding that their choices have moral implications for themselves, their families, and the rest of the world.The previous reviewer asks what she thinks is a rhetorical question: ""Imagine the outrage if someone wrote a manifesto saying all women should be compelled to stay home and raise babies!"" I think that book's been written, several times over, by Laura Schlessinger, James Dobson, Danielle Crittenden, Caitlyn Flanagan, Penelope Leach, T. Berry Brazelton, Phyllis Schlaffly, Rick Santorum, and dozens more reactionary celebrities who cling to essentialist ideas about gender because of their fear of American values, democracy, and modernity. We're so accustomed to hearing the ""opt-out"" decision framed as a moral choice that sanctifies wives and mothers who don't work for pay and demonizes women who do as grasping, unnatural, and selfish that it is a bracing shock to the system to read an argument that turns this so-called ""morality"" on its head. She makes a compelling case that women should remain in the paid workforce for two big reasons: first, because true feminist change is unlikely to happen if a majority of educated women ""opt-out"" of reaching the highest ranks in their profession, and second, for the family's economic security. Thus women who ""opt-out"" endanger both the goal of true gender equality and their own families.I seriously doubt that most of the reviews here were written by people who have bothered to read the book. I think these are mostly reactions to her recent articles in the American Prospect and the Washington Post, by people who may have been (reasonably) offended by Hirschman's claim that there's something infantilizing about working in the domestic sphere only. I have my questions about Hirschman's prescriptions--for example, she doesn't say who exactly should do all of the domestic work she slights--but I think her book gives us a refreshing take on work/home issues.",1
The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,"Referring to ""Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, "" H. L. Mencken noted that his discovery of this classic American novel was ""the most stupendous event of my whole life""; Ernest Hemingway declared that ""all modern American literature stems from this one book,"" while T. S. Eliot called Huck ""one of the permanent symbolic figures of fiction, not unworthy to take a place with Ulysses, Faust, Don Quixote, Don Juan, Hamlet."" The novel's preeminence derives from its wonderfully imaginative re-creation of boyhood adventures along the mighty Mississippi River, its inspired characterization, the author's remarkable ear for dialogue, and the book's understated development of serious underlying themes: ""natural"" man versus ""civilized"" society, the evils of slavery, the innate value and dignity of human beings, the stultifying effects of convention, and other topics. But most of all, ""Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"" is a wonderful story filled with high adventure and unforgettable characters (including the great river itself) that no one who has read it will ever forget.

The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics),"Not that Hemingway was correct, but he did write in 1935: ""All modern American literature comes from one book by Mark Twain called Huckleberry Finn;” unless we are to interpret the adjective 'modern' as 'unadorned.' But Hemingway's remark somehow points to the importance of Mark Twain's breezy, fresh, and straight-forward style.Huckleberry Finn is a poor child whose only family is “Pap” —his abusive drunk father. Huck runs away, and meets Jim, a slave, who is also running away. So, here we have from the very beginning of the novel, two heavy topics: child abuse and slavery. Although Mark Twain has been criticized for his stereotypical presentation Jim, he —a white author— imbues Jim with much humanity in an era in which slaves were considered sub-human. Had any other writer dare do such a thing? Dis anyone else besides Jane Austen write about the slave trade? It took courage to deal with such themes. But Mark Twain also threw other ethical dilemmas into the fray: It is right to obey wrong laws? Should the individual suffer to preserve society?Hence the universal importance of the book.To do honor to the original version, my editorial corrections are minimal. The language —including the dialects— have been left untouched, as well as terms today deemed offensive.","['Mark Twain', 'Marciano Guerrero']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xU7QoQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=xU7QoQEACAAJ&dq=The+Adventures+of+Huckleberry+Finn+(Courage+Literary+Classics)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Createspace Independent Pub,2014-09-27,http://books.google.com/books?id=xU7QoQEACAAJ&dq=The+Adventures+of+Huckleberry+Finn+(Courage+Literary+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],3415.0,0762405414,,A2LZ98NT17B32Q,Justin Evans,98/111,5.0,982713600,"A book not meant for everyone, but everyone should READ it.","When I first read this book, I was so taken with it, that I read from chapter 18 through the end of the book in one night.

(and does this woman have any idea of the conditions in ireland in the 1500's?) also, the continual references to christianity, probably thanks to her source, were off-putting, as well as inaccurate.okay, i'll stop the historical criticism, and get to the bits beadworkers want to hear about. no, one more comment--crochet did not generate income during the famine in ireland, since england didn't allow ireland a cash economy until later in the century. irish style crochet was a LATE 19th century development. i really will stop now, there are far to many other inaccuracies to tackle individually.another reviewer has mentioned the really poor directions. one example not mentioned specifically, tubular bead crochet, is not explained sufficiently in the opening chapters--in fact, not until the SECOND project is there any explanation of the massively important technique for keeping the bead on the outside of the tube. if anyone gets past the first tubular project, it will be only with incredible luck. this is inexcusable, as 'beadwork' magazine has published better directions for tubular crochet in more than one issue. i know this, since i used these articles to teach myself beaded tubular crochet.i objected to the inclusion of so many other techniques. the directions for peyote, etc., are fine if you already know what you're doing, but less than sketchy for new beaders. but, since this is supposed to be a book about bead crochet, why are other techniques incorporated?i, too, think the author's designs are unattractive. in fact, i think most of them are revolting.the best part of the book is the pictures of antique bead crochet items. now, these are inspiring! these are beautiful. these are varied. they are the only reason i will keep this book in my library.",0
"The Clash of Fundamentalisms: Crusades, Jihads and Modernity","Depicts the author's viewpoint about the warring Muslim and Christian ""fundamentalist"" nations post-September 11, drawing conclusions on American ideologies and promoting a new enlightenment for the 21st century.",['Tariq Ali'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=C8h_VjG4ucsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=C8h_VjG4ucsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Clash+of+Fundamentalisms:+Crusades,+Jihads+and+Modernity&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Verso,2003,"http://books.google.com/books?id=C8h_VjG4ucsC&dq=The+Clash+of+Fundamentalisms:+Crusades,+Jihads+and+Modernity&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Political Science'],2.0,1859846793,,A2NYJBKWC15IDI,Carool Kersten,98/110,4.0,1024185600,Iconoclastic account of world affairs,"For those who want to understand how such seemingly disparate issues like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the Kashmir question, and the situation in Afghanistan fit together in the Post-Cold War world this latest book by Tariq Ali is almost mandatory reading.This is surely a very personal account of world affairs, and in many instances the author is driven just as much by his own convictions as by a desire to explain. For this is not an unbiased analysis. But to be fair to the author, the iconoclastic Tariq Ali makes no attempt to hide this and would be the first to admit that he has his own political agenda.Readers who do not share Ali's political ideology, and this reviewer is one of them, should nevertheless not be put off by this. For the very value of THE CLASH OF FUNDAMENTALISMS is that it captures a mood, a mood prevalent among scores of people in what we like to call the Third World. And as the anthropologist Clifford Geertz has explained in an entirely different context, moods are just as potent as driving forces for human behavior as the more focussed motivations.Another quality that the author can not be denied is courage. The opening sentence of the first chapter is namely: I never really believed in God. Not many people of Muslim extraction would have dared to make such a confession, at least not since the Salman Rushdie Affair.Tariq Ali is indeed not your average representative of the Third World citizen. Born in a family of feudal landowners in the Punjab province of British India, which was divided after the partition between Pakistan and India, his relatives played a role in politics before and after independence: a grandfather was chief minister, and others held senior positions in the armed forces or served in parliament. Ali's parents, however, became staunch Marxists, while he himself is a self-confessed Trotskyist. Since his student-days he has been at the forefront of many political activities at the extreme left of the political spectrum.His family background and his own political activism have made Tariq Ali a uniquely well-connected man, and this book has benefited from that. Throughout the years the author has had access to the military and political establishment in Pakistan, worked for the Russell Tribunal, traveled in worn-torn Northern Vietnam and visited Palestinian refugee camps. He shows himself not only very well read in Islamic history, but is also conversant with the writings of political radicals of both left and right. He augments his account with examples from literature: critical writers such as Abd al-Rahman Munif and Nizar Kabbani are or were personal acquaintances.All this makes his book an important read for everybody who wants to at least attempt to view the world through the eyes of `the Wretched of the Earth'.In the first part Tariq Ali gives a genealogy of the heritage of Islamic civilization. Taking us from his personal introduction to Islamic learning, via the days of the Prophet Muhammad and early conquests to the crusades and the Ottoman Empire. This is followed by two more thematic chapters on the wide diversity of Islamic doctrines - meant to dispel the incorrect image of Islam as a monolithic bloc - and a very interesting discourse on gender issues in Islam.In the second part of the book the author introduces us into the modern Middle East. Here Ali explains the way a puritanical strand of Islam ends up making common cause with the imperialistic designs of the West, and how the founding of Israel turned the Middle East into a political quagmire, both because of irreconcilable differences and outside manipulations. It is the author's accomplishment to give a readable account of how Zionism, the experiments with socialism in Arab countries such as Egypt and Syria, the trauma caused by the 1967 war, the rise and fall of Anwar Sadat and the Shah, have all been instrumental in creating a mood, which in 1987 exploded into the Intifadah. The result was that during the last decades of the twentieth century virtually the whole Middle East was submerged in an 'Ocean of Terror'.In the next part, Ali shifts his attention back to his region of origin: South Asia. Because I am not as familiar with this part of the world as with the Middle East, I found this the most informative part of the book. The author explains how the tensions between India and Pakistan can be traced back to the undesired partition of former British India. During the run-up to independence the leaders of the Congress Party and Muslim League did not envisage the horror and atrocities to which they would expose the people they were suppose to represent. Later on it lead to a bloody war in Bangladesh, while Tariq Ali qualifies the Kashmir issue as the unfinished business of partition. Continued interference by the post-Word War II superpowers did nothing to improve the situation. Pakistani and Indian politics became already hopelessly corrupt, even before the situation got completely out of hand in Afghanistan.While in the previous parts the author has tried to give an explanation for the rage that is holding large parts of the Islamic world in its grip, his final section starts with a chapter entitled `A Short-Course History of US Imperialism'. In many instances Ali hits the nail on the head - the doctrine of Neo-Liberalism is just as fundamentalist in character as Islamic radicalism. His comparison between the theses presented by two high priests of post-Cold War doctrine, Francis Fukuyama and Samuel Huntington, I found particularly insightful. But at the same time the author's personal political predilections come to the fore as he can not resist filling us in on the involvement of these two `state intellectuals' in some of America's unsavory political actions. Kissinger, Brzezinski and Madeleine Albright are taken to task for this as well. A few quotations from Leon Trotsky, by contrast, serve to present him as a visionary, and there is unfortunately also little or no real analysis of what made Marxism-Leninism fail in the end.But in short, THE CLASH OF FUNDAMENTALISMS is a very valuable book for those who want to look beyond the scare mongering of myopic politicians and sensationalist media. In addition to that, is Tariq Ali an entertaining writer as well.",1
God of Small Things 1ST Edition Us,,,,,,,,,,B000PXWA1O,,,,98/109,5.0,979171200,Absolutely Astounding,"Roy's mastery of metaphor and creativity in wordplay may just be among the best in the English language today. In The God of Small Things she tells a haunting tragedy in hauntingly beautiful prose that borders on poetry. Almost every scene painted itself visibly in my mind, but in particular I find myself dwelling on the OrangedrinkLemondrink Man, and on the airport scene: Ambassadors E. Pelvis and S. Insect; Rahel wrapping herself in the dirty curtain to escape the reeling changes in her life. I'm so impressed by Roy's ability to see a child's-eye view of the world, and it's so easy to believe that Rahel and Estha would assume that &quot;love had been reapportioned.&quot; It's also a remarkable achievement in non-linear storytelling for a first-time novelist.Having said all that, I confess to loving non-linear narrative. If you don't like it, you probably won't think much of this book.Finally, and coincidentally, just before I read The God of Small Things I read Green English, by linguist Loreto Todd. It's a nonfiction book and I won't go into her thesis. But at one point she suggests that some of the best literature of the 20th century comes from countries where one language (usually a colonizing language, as in India, Ireland, New Zealand, numerous African countries...) has overlaid and been adapted to fit an earlier language, pushing the boundaries of expression. This book seems to me to be a prime example of that idea.",1

I really enjoyed it in spite of it's disturbing revelations, the author's sometimes awkward writing style and on occasion, his questionable conclusions. For anyone with an interest in world affairs - past, present &amp; future - or the political ambitions of the Vatican (which Phelps argues is really one in the same) this is a valuable perspective to gather.Phelps does a very good job illustrating the ubiquitous nature of Jesuit insidiousness throughout modern political, economic &amp; cultural history. In highlighting the diabolical essence of the order, he sheds light on the unequivocal and nearly universal distain for the Jesuits by heads of state since their inception in the late 1500s. These include Napoleon Bonaparte (who, in his memoirs, called them a military order, not a religious one), Oliver Cromwell, George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.Although the rational for many the arguments is well documented, I don't know if the veracity of all of the conclusions can be tested. The book contains endless quotes and citations, yet not everything comes together as tightly as I would have liked (at least after one read). That said, I still think Phelps is on target and proves more than enough of his points to be taken seriously.The book is well organized however it covers so much territory it's easy to become overwhelmed. This is a function of the subject more than anything else. While it can be considered both an introductory text and more of an advanced study, the average reader will likely need to do additional reading and investigation outside of what Phelps gives (thus the reason for the several full length books included on the CD-ROM that comes with VA).According to Phelps (and I think he makes his case) ignoring the Jesuits &amp; the Vatican as a political, financial, cultural and spiritual force, is perilous to a free society and free people everywhere. Its a very timely read and is one of those books you'll want to read many times if you take the topic of world affairs (including economic/cultural globalization and the 'War on Terrorism') seriously at all. Definitely buy it.",1
Catch-22,"This fiftieth-anniversary edition commemorates Joseph Heller’s masterpiece with a new introduction; critical essays and reviews by Norman Mailer, Alfred Kazin, Anthony Burgess, and others; rare papers and photos; and much more. Nominated as one of America’s best-loved novels by PBS’s The Great American Read. Soon to be a Hulu limited series starring Christopher Abbott, George Clooney, Kyle Chandler, and Hugh Laurie. Fifty years after its original publication, Catch-22 remains a cornerstone of American literature and one of the funniest—and most celebrated—books of all time. In recent years it has been named to “best novels” lists by Time, Newsweek, the Modern Library, and the London Observer. Set in Italy during World War II, this is the story of the incomparable, malingering bombardier, Yossarian, a hero who is furious because thousands of people he has never met are trying to kill him. But his real problem is not the enemy—it is his own army, which keeps increasing the number of missions the men must fly to complete their service. Yet if Yossarian makes any attempt to excuse himself from the perilous missions he’s assigned, he’ll be in violation of Catch-22, a hilariously sinister bureaucratic rule: a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but if he makes a formal request to be removed from duty, he is proven sane and therefore ineligible to be relieved. This fiftieth-anniversary edition commemorates Joseph Heller’s masterpiece with a new introduction by Christopher Buckley; a wealth of critical essays and reviews by Norman Mailer, Alfred Kazin, Anthony Burgess, and others; rare papers and photos from Joseph Heller’s personal archive; and much more.

Critical acclaim is nearly universal for this gripping, accurate, and well-told story of the greatest American victory over the Germans during WWII and the only large-scale offensive battle ever fought during the winter, the worst in Europe is some fifty years. Toland veers from the usual historian's path by telling the story in terms of the foot soldier both on the ground and on the defensive against the final counterattack of the Wehrmacht with over a thousand tanks (including many of the new tougher Tiger and Panther models) and more than 250,000 battle-hardened soldiers.Against them were just three full strength (and very green and inexperienced) American divisions with some reserves regiments composed of more experienced soldiers in the heavily wooded and almost impassable woods of the Ardennes forest area. Eisenhower's logistics support was strung out and unable to adequately supply the broad-based front that had evolved after the initial breakout from D-Day. Consequently, it was difficult to arm and support all the troops, and amazingly, Hitler's masterful attack struck exactly at the single weakest point along the line. The result was a complete but temporary disaster, but one that pitted poorly equipped, armed, and clothed U.S. Army troops against a much larger, better armed, clothed and equipped enemy who was striking with blitzkrieg speed and effectiveness.What happened in those woods is the stuff of history, and is commonly referred to as the Battle of the Bulge. The simple truth of the matter is that American troops simply outfought, outlasted, and outsmarted their German opponents in a deadly game of attrition and standoffs in the worst possible weather and cold conditions. Those who like to say the Americans (along with the Allies) won the war largely because we simply out manned and out supplied tour opponents had better take a good look at how well we also outfought them in the Ardennes generally and at Bastogen in particular when we had none of those advantages. Outgunned, out manned, and outflanked, the Americans simply fought back with murderous ferocity and beat the Germans to a bloody pulp.This is truly a great book; it is easily the best single volume yet published covering the Battle of the Bulge in detail. I must admit that I do also like John Eisenhower's &quot;The Bitter Woods&quot; and Stephen Ambrose's &quot;Citizen Soldiers&quot; as well. Both of these are excellent books, built neither measures up to the sheer brilliance of ""Battle"". So, amigo, for the one most exciting, best reading, and painfully accurate and detailed account of the single greatest successful encounter of the U.S. Army against the might of the Wehrmacht during World War Two, I recommend this book. In my humble opinion no one really has a complete WWII library without it.",1

Way of Zen,"In his definitive introduction to Zen Buddhism, Alan Watts (""the perfect guide for a course correction in life"" —Deepak Chopra), explains the principles and practices of this ancient religion. With a rare combination of freshness and lucidity, he delves into the origins and history of Zen to explain what it means for the world today with incredible clarity. Watts saw Zen as “one of the most precious gifts of Asia to the world,” and in The Way of Zen he gives this gift to readers everywhere. “Perhaps the foremost interpreter of Eastern disciplines for the contemporary West, Watts had the rare gift of ‘writing beautifully the unwritable.’” —Los Angeles Times",['Alan Watts'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5NuOYxuDbS0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=5NuOYxuDbS0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Way+of+Zen&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Vintage,2011-02-16,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5NuOYxuDbS0C&source=gbs_api,['Philosophy'],13.0,B000PVBXO6,,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,Dennis Littrell,98/107,5.0,1008720000,Worth a couple dozen other books on Zen Buddhism,"This can be seen as a significant book in the transmission of the dharma to the Western world, even though, or perhaps especially because, it is written by a Westerner. Consistently admired since its first publication in 1957, and reprinted many times, The Way of Zen is that rarest of books, a popular and academic success. You will not read far before seeing why. Watts's style is reasoned and reasonable, clear and authoritative, but without a hint of affectation. Watts knows what he is talking about and to whom he is speaking. Because of his perspective between two worlds, he is, more than almost any other writer on Zen, able to match the ideas of the East to the mind of the West, and in doing so make the broader outlines of Zen as clear as the polished, dustless mirror.The book is divided into two parts, ""Background and History"" and Principles and Practice,"" each with four chapters.

The first chapter is one of the best on Taoism that I have ever read, replete with insight and wisdom.

(p. 11) Perhaps Watts is also indicating why he believes that humanism is not a complete answer.On the cosmology of the Tao: ""...the natural universe works mainly according to the principles of growth...If the universe were made, there would of course be someone who knows &lt;how> it is made..."" He adds, ""...the Tao does not &lt;know> how it produces the universe..."" (pp. 16-17)""Since opposed principles, or ideologies, are irreconcilable, wars fought over principle will be wars of mutual annihilation.

(pp. 29-30)""Hindu philosophy has not made the mistake of imagining that one can make an informative, factual, and positive statement about the ultimate reality."" (p, 34)""Buddhism has frequently compared the course of time to the apparent motion of a wave, wherein the actual water only moves up and down, creating the illusion of a of water moving over the surface.

(p. 123)In his exploration of koans used by the Rinzai School of Zen, it becomes clear that one of the purposes of the koan is to put doubt into the mind of the young aspirant that he knows anything at all. From that redoubtable position, real learning can begin. I was reminded of a saying attributed to baseball's Earl Weaver, the very successful manager of the Baltimore Orioles in their glory years: ""It's what you learn after you know it all that counts.""Here is a story from the Ch'uan Teng Lu, told by Watts about ""a fascinating encounter between Tao-hsin and the sage Fa-yung, who lived in a lonely temple on Mount Niu-t'ou, and was so holy that the birds used to bring him offerings of flowers. As the two men were talking, a wild animal roared close by, and Tao-hsin jumped. Fa-yung commented, --referring, of course, to the instinctive (klesa) of fright.

Great Gatsby (Everyman),"Fitzgerald's masterpiece--the quintessential Jazz Age novel--now in a hardcover Everyman's Library Contemporary Classics edition For generations of enthralled readers, F. Scott Fitzgerald's mysterious millionaire, Jay Gatsby, has come to embody all the glamour and decadence of the Roaring Twenties. Gatsby emerges as if from nowhere, evading questions about his past and throwing dazzling parties sparkling with champagne and jazz at his luxurious Long Island mansion. Nick Carraway, a young man who has moved in next door, is fascinated by his oddly detached neighbor, and by his discovery that Gatsby is motivated by a single-minded quest to regain his long-lost love, Daisy Buchanan. Nick finds something both appalling and appealing about the intensity of Gatsby's ambition to reinvent himself. But Daisy and her wealthy husband are cynical and careless people, and as Gatsby's dream collides with reality, Nick is witness to the violence and tragedy that result. The Great Gatsby's remarkable staying power, nearly a century after its publication, is owed both to the lyrical freshness of its storytelling and to the way that it illuminates the hollow core of the glittering American dream. Everyman's Library pursues the highest production standards, printing on acid-free cream-colored paper, with full-cloth cases with two-color foil stamping, decorative endpapers, silk ribbon markers, European-style half-round spines, and a full-color illustrated jacket.",['F.

I think it masks some shortcoming in the examples it uses. But once you get past that, this is still the best introduction to object-oriented programming that I have read.HFDP is not just about design patterns. It's a great introduction to object-oriented programming. The book does a great job of explaining the benefits of OOP over traditional procedural programming, and it explains OOP very well in terms of the most commonly used design patterns.Now for the bad news. The examples are rather lightweight. They do a pretty good job of illustrating the concepts presented, but the code is in no way real-world. For example, if you are looking for which pattern to use to organize a UI (the 'Mediator', 'State', and 'Composite' patterns), with sample code, you won't find it here. The patterns are discussed, but they are used to create quacking ducks (really).While that's by-and-large a shortcoming of the book, the code is so simple that non-Java programmers (like me) should have no problem using the book. The code samples are very basic, and should translate with little difficulty into .NET languages such as C# and VB.One other item of note--this book contains a pretty good chapter on Model-View-Controller architecture, which seems to bedevil a lot of people. If you can get a handle on MVC, then you can pretty much do OOP.In short, this is probably the book I would recommend as an intro to OOP. If you are under the age of 30, you will probably like the examples of quacking duck simulators and java-enabled gumball machines. For everybody else--it's worth looking past this book's insufferable cuteness if you are getting started in OOP.",1

The Divine Nine: The History of African American Fraternities and Sororities,"This comprehensive history of African American fraternities and sororities celebrates the spirit of Black Excellence in higher education that has produced American leaders in politics, sports, arts, and culture such as Kamala Harris, Colin Kaepernick, Michael Jordan, Thurgood Marshall, and Toni Morrison, and is sure to be a treasured resource for generations to come. America’s Black fraternities and sororities are a unique and vital part of 20th century African American history, providing young black achievers with opportunities to support each other while they serve their communities and the nation. From pioneering work in the suffragette movement to extraordinary strides during the Civil Rights era to life-changing inner-city mentoring programs, members of these organizations share a proud tradition of brotherhood, sisterhood, and service. Today, America’s nine black fraternities and sororities are millions of members strong with chapters at HBCUs, Ivy League Schools, and colleges across the nation including Stanford University, Howard University, and the University of Chicago.",['Lawrence C.

Ross, Jr. It is a must have book that all Black Greeks and African Americans in general should display on their bookshelves!The author is a 15 year member of Alpha Phi Alpha, married to a soror of Delta Sigma Theta and is a journalist who has written for many newpapers. He realized that the history of our organizations is an important part of the history of our people in this country in this century and should be told. The time and effort that he put into compiling the information in the book must have been mammoth.The book is divided into sections profiling each sorority and fraternity. Each section contains a historical overview, interviews with an undergraduate and a graduate chapter, profiles and lists of prominent members, messages from the national president/basileus/polemarch and pictures dating back to the early years. This is followed by a section entitled Achievers Talk which consists of interviews with members such as Spencer Christian, Nikki Giovanni, Gwendolyn Goldsby Grant, Cynthia Horner, John H. Johnson, Julian Malveaux, Shaquille O'Neal, Tavis Smiley, Faye Wattleton, just to name a few. They each speak about what membership means to them and impart an important message that they feel fraters and sorors should hear. The author follows this section with information from the National Pan Hellenic Council and procedures for those who are seeking membership.Our organizations could not have done a better public relations job. There are no secrets revealed, just great accomplishments. The recurring theme is our achievements as organizations and those of individual members. We all know about the projects that our own sorority/fraternity have championed and are proud. When you look at the collective activities, our contributions to our people and communities have been and continue to be monumental. It's only appropriate that this book was written at this time when we are in the process of changing centuries and approaching the anniversaries of 100 years of existance.This is something I think we all need to support and applaud.LTB",1
"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","""In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert’s there are few."" So begins this most beloved of all American Zen books. Seldom has such a small handful of words provided a teaching as rich as has this famous opening line. In a single stroke, the simple sentence cuts through the pervasive tendency students have of getting so close to Zen as to completely miss what it’s all about. An instant teaching on the first page. And that’s just the beginning. In the forty years since its original publication, Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind has become one of the great modern Zen classics, much beloved, much reread, and much recommended as the best first book to read on Zen. Suzuki Roshi presents the basics—from the details of posture and breathing in zazen to the perception of nonduality—in a way that is not only remarkably clear, but that also resonates with the joy of insight from the first to the last page. It’s a book to come back to time and time again as an inspiration to practice, and it is now available to a new generation of seekers in this fortieth anniversary edition, with a new afterword by Shunryu Suzuki’s biographer, David Chadwick.",['Shunryu Suzuki'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=syLKN1q19NgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=syLKN1q19NgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Zen+Mind,+Beginner%27s+Mind&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Shambhala Publications,2010-11-09,"http://books.google.com/books?id=syLKN1q19NgC&dq=Zen+Mind,+Beginner%27s+Mind&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Religion'],26.0,B000J4M79E,,A1DGSUJ89KN91K,"tepi ""tepi""",98/107,5.0,992304000,A golden book on what the Buddha was really all about.,"ZEN MIND, BEGINNER'S MIND : Informal talks on Zen Meditation and practice by Shunryu Suzuki. Edited by Trudy Dixon, with a Preface by Huston Smith and an Introduction by Richard Baker. 138 pp. New York and Tokyo : Weatherhill, 1970 and Reprinted.Some years ago I undertook a fairly extensive program of reading in Indian, Chinese, and Japanese Buddhism and in Zen. Most of my Zen books have since disappeared. Only the choicest remain, among which is Shunryu Suzuki's 'Zen Mind Beginner's Mind.'Buddhism may be said to have begun with the enlightement of the Buddha. Many centuries later, however, when Buddhism entered China, an incredibly elaborate and complex superstructure of Indian scholastic thought had grown up around the Buddha's original insight. The Chinese, with their basically down-to-earth and common sense attitude, had little use for Indian over-elaboration and set about ridding Buddhism of it.The Chinese, as Lin Yutang says, believe in a reasonable use of reason, and not in reason's excesses. The end product of their effort to rid Buddhist thought of its heavy freight of scholasticism, and to shift the emphasis from theory back to the practical by centering Buddhism once again in the enlightenment experience, became what the Chinese know as Ch'an and the Japanese as Zen.As Shunryu Suzuki himself pointed out, when freed of unnecessary theory and speculation, Buddhism as Zen becomes something that is basically &quot;quite simple&quot; (page 64). Its essence was brilliantly captured in the thirty-one verses of Third Patriarch Seng-ts'an's 'Hsin-hsin-ming,' the very first Zen treatise in verse. This is a beautiful text that deserves to be far better known, and an easily accessible translation will be found in D. T. Suzuki's 'Manual of Zen Budhism' ('On Believing in Mind,' pages 76-82).The first verse of the original Chinese may be read as follows, with oblique marks to indicate line breaks:&quot;To realize the Way is not difficult / If you'd only stop choosing; / Just let go of all of your hate, and love, / And everything will be brilliantly clear&quot; (my transl).This statement may gain in meaning if we set it alongside an observation made by the great Zen Master Dogen (1200-1253), founder of the Japanese Soto sect of Zen Buddhism and one of the most brilliant philosophical minds Buddhism has ever produced, who wrote in 'Genjo Koan,' the third chapter of his 'Shobogenzo' :&quot;Conveying the self to the myriad things to authenticate them is delusion; the myriad things advancing to authenticate the self is enlightenment&quot; (Tr., F. H. Cook, 'Sounds of Valley Streams,' page 66).Suzuki Shunryu, who as a member of the Soto school was a direct spiritual descendant of Dogen, would certainly have understood this. In fact, so far as I can see, the idea expressed by both Seng-ts'an and Dogen Zenji is at the very center of his book.'Zen Mind Beginner's Mind' is a golden book that may be heartily recommended to all open-minded readers. In it they will find a Buddhism freed of all scholastic superfluities and unnecessary elaboration, and one that returns us to what the Buddha was really about.",1
The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library),"A must-have new edition of one of the great American novels--and one of America's most popular--featuring a new introduction by Min Jin Lee, the New York Times bestselling author of Pachinko, and a striking new cover that brings the quintessential novel of the Roaring Twenties into the 2020s A Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition Young, handsome, and fabulously rich, Jay Gatsby seems to have everything. But at his mansion east of New York City, in West Egg, Long Island, where the party never seems to end, he's often alone in the glittering Jazz Age crowd, watching and waiting, as speculation swirls around him--that he's a bootlegger, that he was a German spy during the war, that he even killed a man. As writer Nick Carraway is drawn into this decadent orbit, he begins to see beneath the shimmering surface of the enigmatic Gatsby, for whom one thing will always be out of reach: Nick's cousin, the married Daisy Buchanan, whose house is visible from Gatsby's just across the bay. A brilliant evocation of the Roaring Twenties and a satire of a postwar America obsessed with wealth and status, The Great Gatsby is a novel whose power remains undiminished after a century. This edition, based on scholarship dating back to the novel's first publication in 1925, restores Fitzgerald's masterpiece to the original American classic he envisioned, and features an introduction addressing how gender, race, class, and sexuality complicate the pursuit of the American Dream.",['F.

The way of Zen (Pelican books),,['Alan Watts'],,http://books.google.com/books?id=ZuyAngEACAAJ&dq=The+way+of+Zen+(Pelican+books)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,[New York] : New American Library,1962,http://books.google.com/books?id=ZuyAngEACAAJ&dq=The+way+of+Zen+(Pelican+books)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Zen Buddhism'],12.0,B0000CLAK3,,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,Dennis Littrell,98/107,5.0,1008720000,Worth a couple dozen other books on Zen Buddhism,"This can be seen as a significant book in the transmission of the dharma to the Western world, even though, or perhaps especially because, it is written by a Westerner. Consistently admired since its first publication in 1957, and reprinted many times, The Way of Zen is that rarest of books, a popular and academic success. You will not read far before seeing why. Watts's style is reasoned and reasonable, clear and authoritative, but without a hint of affectation. Watts knows what he is talking about and to whom he is speaking. Because of his perspective between two worlds, he is, more than almost any other writer on Zen, able to match the ideas of the East to the mind of the West, and in doing so make the broader outlines of Zen as clear as the polished, dustless mirror.The book is divided into two parts, ""Background and History"" and Principles and Practice,"" each with four chapters. There is a bibliography also divided into two parts, the first referring to original sources and second to general works on Zen in European languages. There are 16 pages of Chinese Notes in calligraphy keyed to the text, and an Index.""The Way"" in the title refers to the ""watercourse way"" from Taoism, a philosophy to which Zen owes much, as Watts makes clear in the first two chapters, ""The Philosophy of the Tao"" and ""The Origins of Buddhism."" The first chapter is one of the best on Taoism that I have ever read, replete with insight and wisdom. Throughout, Watts expresses himself in an infectious style, even in the very scholarly chapters on the history of Buddhism where he traces Zen from its origin in India, through the Buddha under the Po tree, to Ch'an in China, and finally into Japan. Parallels between the unforced, natural way of Taoism and the spontaneity of Zen Buddhism are explored in a most convincing and engaging manner. Along the way we learn a little about Hinduism and Confucianism.The chapters on the principles and practices of Zen, comprising a goodly portion of the book are nothing short of marvelous, full of wit and sly observations, revealing Watts's thorough knowledge of Zen and his deep appreciation. Here are some examples of Watts at work:Referring obliquely to the rise of communism (a word he never uses in the book) he writes, ""When the throne of the Absolute is left vacant, the relative usurps it..."" (p. 11) Perhaps Watts is also indicating why he believes that humanism is not a complete answer.On the cosmology of the Tao: ""...the natural universe works mainly according to the principles of growth...If the universe were made, there would of course be someone who knows &lt;how> it is made..."" He adds, ""...the Tao does not &lt;know> how it produces the universe..."" (pp. 16-17)""Since opposed principles, or ideologies, are irreconcilable, wars fought over principle will be wars of mutual annihilation. But wars fought for simple greed will be far less destructive, because the aggressor will be careful not to destroy what he is fighting to capture."" (pp. 29-30)""Hindu philosophy has not made the mistake of imagining that one can make an informative, factual, and positive statement about the ultimate reality."" (p, 34)""Buddhism has frequently compared the course of time to the apparent motion of a wave, wherein the actual water only moves up and down, creating the illusion of a of water moving over the surface. It is a similar illusion that there is a constant &lt;self> moving through successive experiences, constituting a link between them in such a way that the youth becomes the man who becomes the graybeard who becomes the corpse."" (p. 123)In his exploration of koans used by the Rinzai School of Zen, it becomes clear that one of the purposes of the koan is to put doubt into the mind of the young aspirant that he knows anything at all. From that redoubtable position, real learning can begin. I was reminded of a saying attributed to baseball's Earl Weaver, the very successful manager of the Baltimore Orioles in their glory years: ""It's what you learn after you know it all that counts.""Here is a story from the Ch'uan Teng Lu, told by Watts about ""a fascinating encounter between Tao-hsin and the sage Fa-yung, who lived in a lonely temple on Mount Niu-t'ou, and was so holy that the birds used to bring him offerings of flowers. As the two men were talking, a wild animal roared close by, and Tao-hsin jumped. Fa-yung commented, --referring, of course, to the instinctive (klesa) of fright. Shortly afterwards, while he was for a moment unobserved, Tao-hsin wrote the Chinese character for on the rock where Fa-yung was accustomed to sit. When Fa-yung returned to sit down again, he saw the sacred name and hesitated to sit. said Tao-hsin, At this remark Fa-yung was fully awakened...and the birds never brought any more flowers."" (pp. 89-90).While this is an excellent introduction to Zen--and more--for the educated person, it is especially a delight for those of you who have already read a few books on Zen. There is no other book that I know of that goes as deeply into Zen as agreeably as does The Way of Zen.--Dennis Littrell, author of ""Yoga: Sacred and Profane (Beyond Hatha Yoga)""",1
Paradise Lost/Paradise Regained (BBC Radio Collection),,['John Milton'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bSNWFZHTwrAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=bSNWFZHTwrAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Paradise+Lost/Paradise+Regained+(BBC+Radio+Collection)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,1826,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bSNWFZHTwrAC&source=gbs_api,['Bible'],1.0,0563402121,,A2VE83MZF98ITY,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""",98/106,5.0,1058227200,Classic work,"Of Man's first disobedience and the fruitOf that forbidden tree whose mortal tasteBrought death into the world and all our woe,With loss of Eden, till on greater ManRestore us and regain the blissful seatSing, Heavenly Muse...Not a lot people know that 'Paradise Lost' has as a much lesser known companion piece 'Paradise Regained'; of course, it was true during Milton's time as it is today that the more harrowing and juicy the story, the better it will likely be remembered and received.This is not to cast any aspersion on this great poem, however. It has been called, with some justification, the greatest English epic poem. The line above, the first lines of the first book of the poem, is typical of the style throughout the epic, in vocabulary and syntax, in allusiveness. The word order tends toward the Latinate, with the object coming first and the verb coming after.Milton follows many classical examples by personifying characters such as Death, Chaos, Mammon, and Sin. These characters interact with the more traditional Christian characters of Adam, Eve, Satan, various angels, and God. He takes as his basis the basic biblical text of the creation and fall of humanity (thus, 'Paradise Lost'), which has taken such hold in the English-speaking world that many images have attained in the popular mind an almost biblical truth to them (in much the same way that popular images of Hell owe much to Dante's Inferno). The text of Genesis was very much in vogue in the mid-1600s (much as it is today) and Paradise Lost attained an almost instant acclaim.John Milton was an English cleric, a protestant who nonetheless had a great affinity for catholic Italy, and this duality of interests shows in much of his creative writing as well as his religious tracts. Milton was nicknamed 'the divorcer' in his early career for writing a pamphlet that supported various civil liberties, including the right to obtain a civil divorce on the grounds of incompatibility, a very unpopular view for the day. Milton held a diplomatic post under the Commonwealth, and wrote defenses of the governments action, including the right of people to depose and dispose of a bad king.Paradise Lost has a certain oral-epic quality to it, and for good reason. Milton lost his eyesight in 1652, and thus had to dictate the poem to several different assistants. Though influenced heavily by the likes of Virgil, Homer, and Dante, he differentiated himself in style and substance by concentrating on more humanist elements.Say first -- for Heaven hides nothing from thy view,Nor the deep tract of Hell -- say first what causeMoved our grand Parents, in that happy state,Favoured of Heaven so highly, to fall offFrom their Creator and transgress his will,For one restraint, lords of the world besides?Milton drops us from the beginning into the midst of the action, for the story is well known already, and proceeds during the course of the books (Milton's original had 10, but the traditional epic had 12 books, so some editions broke books VII and X into two books each) to both push the action forward and to give developing background -- how Satan came to be in Hell, after the war in heaven a description that includes perhaps the currently-most-famous line:Here we may reign secure, and in my choiceTo reign is worth ambition though in hell:Better to reign in hell, that serve in heav'n.(Impress your friends by knowing that this comes from Book I, lines 261-263 of Paradise Lost, rather than a Star Trek episode!)The imagery of warfare and ambition in the angels, God's wisdom and power and wrath, the very human characterisations of Adam and Eve, and the development beyond Eden make a very compelling story, done with such grace of language that makes this a true classic for the ages. The magnificence of creation, the darkness and empty despair of hell, the manipulativeness of evil and the corruptible innocence of humanity all come through as classic themes. The final books of the epic recount a history of humanity, now sinful, as Paradise has been lost, a history in tune with typical Renaissance renderings, which also, in Milton's religious convictions, will lead to the eventual destruction of this world and a new creation.A great work that takes some effort to comprehend, but yields great rewards for those who stay the course.",1

Schools are rapidly becoming laboratories for the dispensing of psychostimulants and the students are the guinea pigs of choice. And, as always, African Americans and the poor comprise the greatest number of victims. Further complicating matters is the zero value placed on African American boys. African American and Latino boys are the most feared and despised student populations in America. This ugly reality leads to the parents of these boys being conned ( Chap. 2 The Conning of African American Parents) by school employees into targeting, testing, labeling, and medicating their children. Avenues and methods other than labeling and medicating are very seldom sought or employed. The toxic effects of a Eurocentric curriculum on nonwhite minds is ignored by educational professionals, medical professionals, and politicians (Chap. 6 A Curriculum of Genocide). Also, there is much apprehension in examining the relationship between African American boys and White female teachers (Chap. 5). Kill Them Before They Grow takes a hard look at how educational policies (Chap. 1 Public Law 94-142 and the Creation of Black Monsters) can be misused; and how misuse can spiral out of control. Child-victims cannot speak for themselves. African American boys, more than any other child, need caring adults to expose and discuss an ugly reality that, in one way or another, effects everyone.",0

What a man! He is utterly idealistic and principled, but there is never a second of &quot;sappiness&quot; in the author's presentation of his heroism. She provides totally believable motivation for exactly why he seems so noble to others. In short: no matter how many people he has saved in Vietnam and throughout the rest of his illustrious career, he has always regretted the ones he wasn't able to save.At 52, Jake has been widowed for several years after a happy, 30-year marriage to an artist. The heroine, Zoe Lange, is different in every way from Jake's deceased wife, but she is truly his soul mate. Like him, she works in covert operations and feels a huge adrenaline rush from the danger. Because their work is so similar, Zoe understands Jake's career as his dead wife never could.Many times internal conflicts such as Jake's guilt about the age difference between him and Zoe can get tedious in romance because the hero's &quot;angsting&quot; gets excessive. Happily, Ms. Brockmann never crosses that line. The very traits of honor and commitment and deep, abiding love that make the heroine fall in love with Jake are the things that believably keep them apart until the tumultuous climax.Zoe is a fabulous heroine. Brilliant, competent, and independent, she never wanted to marry because she put her career above everything else in life. She loves her work as a scientist specializing in biological warfare. Like Jake, she knows her work is very important because it saves so many lives. So up until Jake, she only got involved with men as potential lovers that she was sure she would fall in love with only a little bit.However, almost immediately with Jake she realizes this is not going to be the case. She loses her previous control, because it is impossible to keep any distance from this incredible man.As for the love scenes--whew! TOTALLY HOT! Because Ms. Brockmann writes in close-third point of view, we get to be intensely immersed in the passionate feelings of each character in these scenes as well as all others. The author never distracts us by the dizzying head-hopping many other romance authors succumb to. We are always close-in and utterly personally involved by her seamless writing style.All in all this is a truly magnificent book worthy of the many awards it will undoubtedly win, as so many other of Ms. Brockmann's books have.

Paradise Lost Paradise Regained,The classic epic poem from John Milton of Satan's war with heaven and his eventual temptation of humanity. A plan is laid out to save humankind which culminates in the last book Paradise Regained.,['John Milton'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZgwiCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=ZgwiCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Paradise+Lost+Paradise+Regained&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Lulu.com,2015-12,http://books.google.com/books?id=ZgwiCwAAQBAJ&dq=Paradise+Lost+Paradise+Regained&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Poetry'],,0717200000,,A2VE83MZF98ITY,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""",98/106,5.0,1058227200,Classic work,"Of Man's first disobedience and the fruitOf that forbidden tree whose mortal tasteBrought death into the world and all our woe,With loss of Eden, till on greater ManRestore us and regain the blissful seatSing, Heavenly Muse...Not a lot people know that 'Paradise Lost' has as a much lesser known companion piece 'Paradise Regained'; of course, it was true during Milton's time as it is today that the more harrowing and juicy the story, the better it will likely be remembered and received.This is not to cast any aspersion on this great poem, however. It has been called, with some justification, the greatest English epic poem. The line above, the first lines of the first book of the poem, is typical of the style throughout the epic, in vocabulary and syntax, in allusiveness. The word order tends toward the Latinate, with the object coming first and the verb coming after.Milton follows many classical examples by personifying characters such as Death, Chaos, Mammon, and Sin. These characters interact with the more traditional Christian characters of Adam, Eve, Satan, various angels, and God. He takes as his basis the basic biblical text of the creation and fall of humanity (thus, 'Paradise Lost'), which has taken such hold in the English-speaking world that many images have attained in the popular mind an almost biblical truth to them (in much the same way that popular images of Hell owe much to Dante's Inferno). The text of Genesis was very much in vogue in the mid-1600s (much as it is today) and Paradise Lost attained an almost instant acclaim.John Milton was an English cleric, a protestant who nonetheless had a great affinity for catholic Italy, and this duality of interests shows in much of his creative writing as well as his religious tracts. Milton was nicknamed 'the divorcer' in his early career for writing a pamphlet that supported various civil liberties, including the right to obtain a civil divorce on the grounds of incompatibility, a very unpopular view for the day. Milton held a diplomatic post under the Commonwealth, and wrote defenses of the governments action, including the right of people to depose and dispose of a bad king.Paradise Lost has a certain oral-epic quality to it, and for good reason. Milton lost his eyesight in 1652, and thus had to dictate the poem to several different assistants. Though influenced heavily by the likes of Virgil, Homer, and Dante, he differentiated himself in style and substance by concentrating on more humanist elements.Say first -- for Heaven hides nothing from thy view,Nor the deep tract of Hell -- say first what causeMoved our grand Parents, in that happy state,Favoured of Heaven so highly, to fall offFrom their Creator and transgress his will,For one restraint, lords of the world besides?Milton drops us from the beginning into the midst of the action, for the story is well known already, and proceeds during the course of the books (Milton's original had 10, but the traditional epic had 12 books, so some editions broke books VII and X into two books each) to both push the action forward and to give developing background -- how Satan came to be in Hell, after the war in heaven a description that includes perhaps the currently-most-famous line:Here we may reign secure, and in my choiceTo reign is worth ambition though in hell:Better to reign in hell, that serve in heav'n.(Impress your friends by knowing that this comes from Book I, lines 261-263 of Paradise Lost, rather than a Star Trek episode!)The imagery of warfare and ambition in the angels, God's wisdom and power and wrath, the very human characterisations of Adam and Eve, and the development beyond Eden make a very compelling story, done with such grace of language that makes this a true classic for the ages. The magnificence of creation, the darkness and empty despair of hell, the manipulativeness of evil and the corruptible innocence of humanity all come through as classic themes. The final books of the epic recount a history of humanity, now sinful, as Paradise has been lost, a history in tune with typical Renaissance renderings, which also, in Milton's religious convictions, will lead to the eventual destruction of this world and a new creation.A great work that takes some effort to comprehend, but yields great rewards for those who stay the course.",1

Scalia offers up a 50 page paper on the various methods of judicial interpretation, each methods strengths and weaknesses, and the how and why of whether or not each method is viable.Scalia's paper is then cross-examined by Ronald Dworkin, Mary Ann Glendon, Amy Gutmann, Lawrence Tribe and Gordon Wood. Scalia then offers up his rebuttal and I believe, strengthens his theories of judicial interpretation. I am not going to go into my own how's and why's, as I am a fan of Scalia's and would rather allow the reader to reach their own conclusions.Whether you like this book, or hate it, one thing is for certain, you will come away with a much better knowledge of the U.S. judicial system, how it reaches some of its conclusions, and what the consequences of continuing with current methods of judicial interpretation will be on our country.Monty Raineywww.juntosociety.com",1
In the Company of the Courtesan: A Novel,"My lady, Fiammetta Bianchini, was plucking her eyebrows and biting color into her lips when the unthinkable happened and the Holy Roman Emperor’s army blew a hole in the wall of God’s eternal city, letting in a flood of half-starved, half-crazed troops bent on pillage and punishment. Thus begins In the Company of the Courtesan, Sarah Dunant’s epic novel of life in Renaissance Italy. Escaping the sack of Rome in 1527, with their stomachs churning on the jewels they have swallowed, the courtesan Fiammetta and her dwarf companion, Bucino, head for Venice, the shimmering city born out of water to become a miracle of east-west trade: rich and rancid, pious and profitable, beautiful and squalid. With a mix of courage and cunning they infiltrate Venetian society. Together they make the perfect partnership: the sharp-tongued, sharp-witted dwarf, and his vibrant mistress, trained from birth to charm, entertain, and satisfy men who have the money to support her. Yet as their fortunes rise, this perfect partnership comes under threat, from the searing passion of a lover who wants more than his allotted nights to the attentions of an admiring Turk in search of human novelties for his sultan’s court. But Fiammetta and Bucino’s greatest challenge comes from a young crippled woman, a blind healer who insinuates herself into their lives and hearts with devastating consequences for them all. A story of desire and deception, sin and religion, loyalty and friendship, In the Company of the Courtesan paints a portrait of one of the world’s greatest cities at its most potent moment in history: It is a picture that remains vivid long after the final page.",['Sarah Dunant'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OjkRJnkEz50C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=OjkRJnkEz50C&printsec=frontcover&dq=In+the+Company+of+the+Courtesan:+A+Novel&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Random House Trade Paperbacks,2007-02-06,http://books.google.com/books?id=OjkRJnkEz50C&dq=In+the+Company+of+the+Courtesan:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],62.0,1400063817,,AC9B29BXXWJHD,K. Huff,98/105,5.0,1141344000,Wonderfully written,"This book was so good that I read it in one sitting. In this book Dunant returns to the place and time she does best: Renaissance Italy. This time the story takes place in Rome and Venice in 1527, and focuses upon Fiametta Bianchi and her dwarfish servant, Bucino Teodaldo. In the Company of the Courtesan is told from his point of view.The book opens in Rome. Fiametta, a successful courtesan, leaves the city with her servant and goes to Venice, the city that was famous in this time period for the courtesans that lived there. Venice is a decadent city, filled with sin and vice, and it is through this that Bucino and his mistress must wade in order for her to be successful in her chosen profession. Along the way we run into a variety of interesting characters: a servant with sticky fingers; a Jew who lives in the Jewish ghetto of Venice; a blind healer called ""La Draga;"" a Turk who is fascinated by Bucino's size; the poet Aretino; the artist Titian; and a variety of Fiametta's clients. Many of the characters were, of course, real people; others, of course, were not. The story that Dunant creates, which mixes what really happened with fiction, is breathtaking.This book is well-written, and very much like The Birth of Venus, Dunant's 2004 novel that is set in Florence at the end of the fifteenth century. In the Company of the Courtesan has the same kind of qualities, but is a great book in its own way.",1

Masters of Death: The SS-Einsatzgruppen and the Invention of the Holocaust,"In Masters of Death, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Rhodes gives full weight, for the first time, to the Einsatzgruppen’s role in the Holocaust. These “special task forces,” organized by Heinrich Himmler to follow the German army as it advanced into eastern Poland and Russia, were the agents of the first phase of the Final Solution. They murdered more than 1.5 million men, women, and children between 1941 and 1943, often by shooting them into killing pits, as at Babi Yar. These massive crimes have been generally overlooked or underestimated by Holocaust historians, who have focused on the gas chambers. In this painstaking account, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Richard Rhodes profiles the eastern campaign’s architects as well as its “ordinary” soldiers and policemen, and helps us understand how such men were conditioned to carry out mass murder. Marshaling a vast array of documents and the testimony of perpetrators and survivors, this book is an essential contribution to our understanding of the Holocaust and World War II.",['Richard Rhodes'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SAQ94hR-YxQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=SAQ94hR-YxQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Masters+of+Death:+The+SS-Einsatzgruppen+and+the+Invention+of+the+Holocaust&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Vintage,2007-12-18,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SAQ94hR-YxQC&source=gbs_api,['History'],9.0,0375409009,,A2EENLV6OQ3DYM,Brian D. Rubendall,98/104,5.0,1027814400,The Horror,"Warning: Richard Rhodes's ""Masters of Death"" is one of the most horrific books you're ever likely to read. It details very completely the history of the roving death squads who followed Adolf Hitler's armies into the conquered territories of the Soviet Union and unleashed the opening salvos of what would later become known as The Holocaust. Many people today think of The Holocaust in terms of Auschwitz and the other death camps. What tends to be forgotten is that the Eisatzgruppen units that started the mass killings of Jews racked up a death toll at least as high as those of the camps. And in most instances, the murders by these minions were even less humane, if that's possible.Rhodes, a fine writer and first rate historian, pulls no punches. Wherever possible, he uses the first hand accounts of both the survivors and the perpetrators to tell his gruesome story. The ghastly pictures that accompany the book only begin to hint and the true horror of the events described. Along the way, Rhodes explores the psychology of the murderers, particularly that of both Hitler and of Reichsfuhrer SS Heinrich Himmler, the man who allowed his whole personality to be subjugated to the Fuhrer. Rhodes also provides enough of the history and ideology of Nazi Germany to set the proper context.At just under three hundred pages of text, the book makes its point concisely. Lest the reader think that what happened has been confined to the dustbin of history, Rhodes points out that Einsatzgruppen methods were recently resurrected by the death squads in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s.Overall, an incredibly powerful and important book that serves as a grim reminder of the darker side of human nature.",0

The book is devastingly brief whilst deriving, in its few pages, all the great results of classical mechanics. Results that in other books take take up many more pages. I first came across Landau's mechanics many years ago as a brash undergrad. My prof at the time had given me this book but warned me that it's the kind of book that ages like wine. I've read this book several times since and I have found that indeed, each time is more rewarding than the last.The reason for the brevity is that, as pointed out by previous reviewers, Landau derives mechanics from symmetry. Historically, it was long after the main bulk of mechanics was developed that Emmy Noether proved that symmetries underly every important quantity in physics. So instead of starting from concrete mechanical case-studies and generalising to the formal machinery of the Hamilton equations, Landau starts out from the most generic symmetry and dervies the mechanics. The 2nd laws of mechanics, for example, is derived as a consequence of the uniqueness of trajectories in the Lagragian. For some, this may seem too ""mathematical"" but in reality, it is a sign of sophisitication in physics if one can identify the underlying symmetries in a mechanical system. Thus this book represents the height of theoretical sophistication in that symmetries are used to derive so many physical results.The difficulty with this approach, and the reason why this book is not a beginner's book, is that to the follow symmetric arguments, one really has to have already mastered vector calculus.

And this is why . . . .I'm sure that there are those of you who have the annotated Wizard of Oz and/or the Dover editions of the Wonderful/Wizard of Oz (Dover has made different copies in publishing it in different ways). the Annotated Wizard of Oz may have the pictures in full-colour, but the colour plates are in 1 whole place, in the middle of the book, and that goes the same for the recent Dover Edition of the Wonderful Wizard of Oz (where Dorothy is wearing a pink dress, talking to her friends, all wearing the Green glasses). The other Dover editions of this story have the pictures in black-and-white (sometimes all, other times, a few of them) with the colour-plates in their own chapter but in black-and-white.THIS EDITION - the 100th Anniversary Edition - is one everybody should have. It has all the pictures in colour-and-black lined with the FULL-COLOUR-Plates in their OWN PROPER CHAPTER place, e.g. ""She caught Toto by the ear"" in THE CYCLONE, ""I am the Witch of the North"" in THE COUNCIL WITH THE MUNCHKINS, etc. It even has the picture of Dorothy and Toto back in Kansas on the very final page on the book in the backboard. And when you pull off this picture-cover (the one that you see now), the actual cardboard-leather-bound cover has the EXACT SAME ORIGINAL Cover Angela Lansbury shows in ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: The Making of a Movie Classic"", where the Cowardly Lion is wearing the Green glasses on the Front cover, Toto is on the spine and the back has the faces of Dorothy, the Scarecrow and (Nick chopper) the Tin Woodman in circles.An Important Note on this story is that it Is Imaginative But it Is Not DARK as some people say. It is not scary nor is it supposed to be attempted that way in any new adaptation, nor should it always be made similar to MGM with constant references or musical scenes. This is an AMERICAN 1900 Story, it is not English/British like J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter, Tolkien's Hobbit/LofR or C. S. Lewis' Narnia - it is its own place!! Oz is a place where animals can talk, there are strange animals who are not mythical and never appeared in any other legends, wicked people are defeated by simple acts, by it accidentally-non-magical or magical, everybody is friends and the ordinary items of our world can have strong but simple magic.Now matter how much the MGM Musical is loved, reading this book is worth it, because it explains how many of the events in Oz came to be when Dorothy arrived: how did the Tin Woodman come to be? How did and why do the Winged Monkeys obey the Wicked Witch of the West? What became of the Winkies after the WWWitch's death? Did Lion become the King of Beasts again? Naturally the musical is different from the book, but despite the change of the Kansas beginning/ending, the story is basically the same. this book only offers MORE than the movie did.Hope you enjoyed my descriptive review. Watch out for my other Oz and Digimon reviews (by Sam A. Milazzo).",1

Learning Irish: An introductory self-tutor,An introductory Irish language course.,"[""Micheal O'Siadhail""]",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EVOcnQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=EVOcnQEACAAJ&dq=Learning+Irish:+An+introductory+self-tutor&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,1995,http://books.google.com/books?id=EVOcnQEACAAJ&dq=Learning+Irish:+An+introductory+self-tutor&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Foreign Language Study'],,B0006EE0EW,,,,98/104,4.0,1020297600,A Comparison Of Two Language Textbooks,"After researching Irish language courses at my local libraries and on-line, I selected two textbooks for my own study of this language. The two books are Teach Yourself Irish by Diarmuid O Se (1993 edition) and Learning Irish by Micheal O. Siadhail (1995 edition). Before reviewing each one, let me first warn those wishing to learn the rudiments of this language that you may find Irish grammar, spelling, and pronunciation hopelessly complex and illogical. (Fortunately, it uses the Roman alphabet.) Whichever book you chose, proceed in small steps. Read just a chapter a day to keep your frustration to a minimum. I recommend beginning with Teach Yourself Irish, which I found the more enjoyable of the two. Each of its 20 chapters opens with short dialogues, topical as well as interesting. Next comes a review of grammar clearly explained at a very basic level. All of the chapters conclude with exercises requiring the reader to answer in short phrases or sentences. There are also illustrations scattered throughout the book, thus breaking up the monotony of the text. Too many other language books, like Learning Irish, lack pictures to liven up the text for the beginner. On the audiotapes for Teach Yourself Irish the dialogues have been re-created by native speakers who demonstrate, as I understand it, the Munster dialect.If you want a more thorough grounding in the language, read Learning Irish next. In its 36 chapters it will reinforce what you have learned in Teach Yourself Irish, explain the grammar in greater depth, and expand your vocabulary. Each chapter begins with a laundry list of words. It is followed by a presentation of grammar which I found quite dry and boring. (It will put you to sleep if you are not careful!) Next there is a paragraph or two to translate, drawing on the words in the vocabulary list. Finally, there are sets of exercises to test your skills, including one English-to-Irish exercise. As a do-it-yourself language student, I found myself too lazy to write out the answers for the exercises in both books. Instead, I would translate by sight, while taking quick peeks at the answer key provided at the back of each book. The audiotapes for Learning Irish offer a detailed treatment of what the author considers the more standardised pronunciation found in Ireland today.A word about dictionaries: The selection of Irish dictionaries currently on the market is disappointing. I ended up buying the Pocket Oxford Irish Dictionary because I thought that it was the best one for beginners. I am still waiting for the big publishing houses, namely Cassell's, Collins, or the Oxford University Press, to put out an up-to-date, standard Irish-English/English-Irish dictionary with a phonetic pronunciation guide for each entry. This book would serve as an essential reference for the intermediate or advanced student.",1
Mechanics (Course of theoretical physics),"Devoted to the foundation of mechanics, namely classical Newtonian mechanics, the subject is based mainly on Galileo's principle of relativity and Hamilton's principle of least action.

In addition a short biography of L D Landau has been inserted.","['L D Landau', 'E.M.

The book is devastingly brief whilst deriving, in its few pages, all the great results of classical mechanics. Results that in other books take take up many more pages. I first came across Landau's mechanics many years ago as a brash undergrad. My prof at the time had given me this book but warned me that it's the kind of book that ages like wine. I've read this book several times since and I have found that indeed, each time is more rewarding than the last.The reason for the brevity is that, as pointed out by previous reviewers, Landau derives mechanics from symmetry. Historically, it was long after the main bulk of mechanics was developed that Emmy Noether proved that symmetries underly every important quantity in physics. So instead of starting from concrete mechanical case-studies and generalising to the formal machinery of the Hamilton equations, Landau starts out from the most generic symmetry and dervies the mechanics. The 2nd laws of mechanics, for example, is derived as a consequence of the uniqueness of trajectories in the Lagragian. For some, this may seem too ""mathematical"" but in reality, it is a sign of sophisitication in physics if one can identify the underlying symmetries in a mechanical system. Thus this book represents the height of theoretical sophistication in that symmetries are used to derive so many physical results.The difficulty with this approach, and the reason why this book is not a beginner's book, is that to the follow symmetric arguments, one really has to have already mastered vector calculus. Ideally, you should be able to transform coordinate in your sleep, perform integrals without missing a beat, whether they be line, area, or path, and differentiate functions in many dimensions. The arguments are not sloppy, as some have claimed - it only seems so if you have not mastered vector calculus.Tradition says that in Plato's academy was engraved the phrase, ""Let no one ignorant of geometry enter here"", so should the modern theoretical physicist, with Landau's bible in hand, march under the arches engraved with the words ""Let no one ignorant of symmetry enter here"".",0
Pompeii: A Novel,"BESTSELLER - ""Terrific... gripping... A literally shattering climax."" -- The New York Times Book Review All along the Mediterranean coast, the Roman empire’s richest citizens are relaxing in their luxurious villas, enjoying the last days of summer. The world’s largest navy lies peacefully at anchor in Misenum. The tourists are spending their money in the seaside resorts of Baiae, Herculaneum, and Pompeii. But the carefree lifestyle and gorgeous weather belie an impending cataclysm, and only one man is worried. The young engineer Marcus Attilius Primus has just taken charge of the Aqua Augusta, the enormous aqueduct that brings fresh water to a quarter of a million people in nine towns around the Bay of Naples. His predecessor has disappeared. Springs are failing for the first time in generations. And now there is a crisis on the Augusta’ s sixty-mile main line—somewhere to the north of Pompeii, on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius. Attilius—decent, practical, and incorruptible—promises Pliny, the famous scholar who commands the navy, that he can repair the aqueduct before the reservoir runs dry. His plan is to travel to Pompeii and put together an expedition, then head out to the place where he believes the fault lies. But Pompeii proves to be a corrupt and violent town, and Attilius soon discovers that there are powerful forces at work—both natural and man-made—threatening to destroy him. With his trademark elegance and intelligence, Robert Harris, bestselling author of Archangel and Fatherland, re-creates a world on the brink of disaster.",['Robert Harris'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=brlPEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=brlPEAAAQBAJ&dq=Pompeii:+A+Novel&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Random House Trade Paperbacks,2005-11-08,http://books.google.nl/books?id=brlPEAAAQBAJ&dq=Pompeii:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],62.0,B000133Q0C,,A1GUWFBWRXTJG0,Eileen Rieback,98/104,4.0,1072828800,Well researched and fascinating,"It is August of 79 A.D. in the Bay of Naples and the Aqua Augusta, the aqueduct carrying water to the cities of the area, begins to dry up. Fish are mysteriously dying in their ponds. There are ground tremors and rock falls in the cities surrounding Mount Vesuvius. Some residents attribute these things to giants or to the wrath of the gods. But Marcus Attilius Primus, the aquarius, or water engineer of the Aqua Augusta, who is sent to Misenum to research and repair the problem, knows that there is a scientific explanation. As he tracks the aqueduct from its terminus in Misenum to Pompeii and then onward to the vicinity of Mount Vesuvius, he observes unusual natural phenomena, discovers the upheaval that disrupted the water flow, and realizes that an inevitable cataclysmic event is about to occur.In this painstakingly researched story, Robert Harris has produced much more than a historical thriller. Although we know the story will end with the eruption of Mount Vesuvius and the destruction of the surrounding cities, Harris has built suspense by describing the mysterious disappearance of the former aquarius Exomnius and the attempts of the officials of Pompeii to prevent Attilius from discovering the truth. This book also provides fascinating detail on the culture of ancient Rome, from the feasts in the sumptuous villas to the ingenious plumbing in the bath houses. It provides details on the aqueduct system, a marvel of Roman engineering. Each chapter is prefaced with an excerpt from a treatise on volcanos that describes the causes of, and events occuring during, an eruption. The reader is entertained while learning all this, and is not overburdened with facts and figures.The characters are well developed and fascinating. The brilliant writer, naturalist, and scholar Pliny the Elder, and the pompous and wealthy city developer Ampliatus come to life through Harris' talent. From slaves to powerful land barons, from laborers to statesmen, the reader is treated to all facets of the citizenry of ancient Pompeii. There is also a weakly developed love interest between Attilius and the daughter of Ampliatus. This is the one part of the story that would have been better if left out. Even with that flaw, the book is compelling reading with a built-in ancient history lesson.",1

There is something for every level from beginner to expert (the most advanced examples were well over my head). The recipes are enhanced by discussions that are mostly very well and clearly written, giving insight into the design and logic of the presented recipes. They thus guide the way to adapting the recipes to your own programs.So, most of the content of this book is good. 4-5 stars for that.Bad / Production:The recipes (so I gather) are mostly edited versions of what is available at ActiveState's online cookbook. However, the edited versions seem not to be available online (at least there is no pointer, and O'Reilly's website does not provide one either). Nor does the book include a CD. For all the hype in the book about this being a book by the Python community for the Python community, this is disappointing. Not even pointers are provided to on-line cookbook recipes that were used as starting points for those printed in this book. This is just bad craftsmanship on the part of O'Reilly. (On a similar note, the back cover promises a foreword by Guido but there isn't one.)Bad / Content:Sugar is sweet but bad for your health. So it is with this book - too many recipes add only (syntactic) sugar but no minerals and vitamins. Several 'shortcuts' are just wasted ink and breath - they will save you 1-2 lines of code when writing a function but then you have to import the shortcut implementation and get to make the extra function calls... Where these 'shortcuts' help to avoid some Python gotchas, it would have been more useful to just document the gotcha in question and show how to avoid it in straight Python code without any sugaring. Case in point: The once-only initialization of function default arguments. If you write:def foo(bar=[])bar.append(quux)then previous quuxes will be lurking in the bars of every subsequent foo call that does not pass bar itself. So, you must write:def foo(bar=None):if not bar: bar=[]to get an empty [] for every call. Now does this 'problem' merit a more elaborate, sugary 'solution'? I don't think so.Some recipes are recipes for disaster. We are told how to automatically call the __init__ routines of every superclass... what we are not told is how to automatically call them in the appropriate order or with the respective arguments for making things work. How often do you write an __init__ that takes only the 'self' argument? Sure, it occurs, but... The omission of implicit superclass calls was a conscious design choice in Python and a wise one at that. Too many recipes like this one just want to show you how to subvert Python's conscious design choices. The sweet taste won't last but give way to heartburn.For a book of this scope and design it is of course impossible to avoid criticism of the kind 'why did you include A but not B...'Still, here goes:XML: There are excellent libraries such as ElementTree and now cElementTree that offer fast, clean and 'Pythonic' alternatives to the standard library modules for XML parsing. More than just a URL pointer should have been provided.Web programming: Only Jython and Twisted are mentioned as alternatives to CGI. Now Twisted may be the greatest thing since sliced bread, but ordinary mortals will never know, because it has about the the most confusing and unfathomable documentation of anything on the web (ooh I forgot Zope...). Presenting Twisted 'recipes' (or rather, plugs) with 'discussions' that drone about its power but are again just the same handwaving stuff as in the on-line docs is useless.(If you just want to get your web stuff done with minimal pain: For simple PHP-like embedded scripting but with the advantages of Python, look at Spyce, and for an easy application server, look at Cherrypy or Webware).So, altogether, a good book but not quite on par with e.g. Python in a Nutshell.",1

The book iscurrent to within the last couple of years -- a quick way to bringyourself up to date.The book has two authors, and each of them has a distinctive voice and personality. You will notice, as you read a chapter, which scientist wrote it. Squires is engaging, wide ranging and conversational. Kandel's prose is single minded and straight to the point. The book appears to be the product of a real collaboration, not just an editor's paste-together or interleaving of two separately contributed manuscripts. By passing the microphone back and forth at timely moments, the two men are able to fill in a large and remarkable picture of what we know now about memory.What is memory? The working hypothesis is that the nervous system rewires itself as an animal acquires new information from the world. This reworking of a pre-existing nervous system is accomplished by altering the strength of synaptic connections between nerves. Novel synaptic connections establish favored conduction pathways within the complex nest of wiring in the brain. These favored pathways are believed to constitute the memory. Although this concept was elaborated by the psychologist Donald Hebb, and is often called the Hebb hypothesis, the authors point out that it has roots in the prescient thinking of the 19th century microscopist, Ramon y Cajal.Kandel develops an explanation of how synaptic changes record memory, using the Aplysia (sea snail) as a prototype. He carries this story right down to the level of the gene. Squires presents the overarching concepts of declarative versus non-declarative memories, introduces the idea that there exist multiple memories in the brain, enumerates and explains them, and sets the stage for an explanation of how short term memory is &quot;switched&quot; biochemically to become long term memory. Chapters 3 and 7 offer nicely detailed descriptions of how synaptic changes occur. These two chapters belong together and you might find it helpful to read them in succession.It is a deeply set assumption in this science, and a rhetorical short cut in this book, that synaptic changes are essentially the same thing as a memory. As A equals B. Synaptic changes do occur, and they do coincide with learning, and both processes are measurable and proved. But a skeptical reader might ask - and really should ask -- if the memory mechanism thus assumed isn't a post hoc fallacy. Maybe memory is not written by and into synapses. Maybe memory is written somewhere else and in some other way. Maybe the experimental results mean something else or something more.The neuron is probably a multichannel device, a cable rather than a wire. This is the only reasonable way to construct a nerve that would enable us to think as fast as we do. Because nerve impulses are so very slow moving, each successive impulse must be rich in information. A multichannel nerve would have the power to convey graded information from one end of a neuron to the other. All the while appearing, to instruments, to convey only the classically blank, &quot;all or nothing&quot; impulse that is so confidently presented to us on the first page of every neurobiology text.Sodium and potassium ions flow into and out of the cell via structured portals in the cell membrane called (fortuitously) sodium and potassium channels. To create a continuous longitudinal information channel running the full length of an axon membrane, one would simply link each ion portal to its next door neighbor. A conformation change in one portal induces a conformation change in the next. One can visualize many parallel tracks, a corduroy membrane. Linked receptors are commonplace. The structure of the potassium channel has been published recently, and so we are now finally working at the level where a multichannel membrane can be detected.At a multichannel nerve's ending, the modification and multiplication of synapses -- that is, the two specific processes so beautifully documented and explained in Chapters 3 and 7 of this book -- might not be writing memory at all. Synaptic changes could simply reflect an underlying scaling or calibration process, the pioneering of a useful operating range. Or a glimpse at the workings of a control network. This is theoretical, however, and the problem of memory has always been a jungle gym for theoreticians. It still is. This is a great book about the memory, and it is also a great book about the synapse. But it does not quite win its implicit argument that the synapse makes the memory. It does succinctly report the factual findings now in hand, many of them quite surprising, and it is current and clear. END",1
Letters of a Woman Homesteader,"This “warmly delightful, vigorously affirmative” memoir of a woman homesteader in early twentieth-century Wyoming inspired the acclaimed film Heartland (The Wall Street Journal). In 1909, Elinore Pruitt answered an ad in the Denver Post to become Henry Clyde Stewart’s housekeeper on his homestead outside Burntfork, Wyoming. Elinore soon fell in love with the land’s vast, untamed beauty, and filed a claim for her own adjoining property under the Homestead Act. Over the next five years, she not only made a home for herself, but traveled extensively across the state, befriending every neighbor within a hundred miles. Through it all—weddings and births, illnesses and snowstorms, changing seasons and changing times—Elinore maintained correspondence with her former employer Juliet Coney in Denver, Colorado. In vivid detail and with lively prose, Elinore told Juliet of life as a woman in the American West. First published in the Atlantic Monthly, these letters made their author an American icon of her time. “Full of the tang of the prairies and of a delightful personality.” —The New York Times",['Elinore Pruitt Stewart'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=u9PVDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=u9PVDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Letters+of+a+Woman+Homesteader&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Open Road Media,2020-03-17,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=u9PVDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Literary Collections'],22.0,0613082370,,,,98/104,5.0,943056000,Proud to be progeny,"Elinore Pruitt Stewart was my grandmother, my father's mother.

Milazzo,98/104,5.0,1084838400,The ORIGINAL Wizard of Oz is Published,"I don't own THIS particular Edition, but I will soon, and as soon as I saw it in Dymmocks, I looked through it and thought ""I've really gotta get this book!"" And this is why . . . .I'm sure that there are those of you who have the annotated Wizard of Oz and/or the Dover editions of the Wonderful/Wizard of Oz (Dover has made different copies in publishing it in different ways). the Annotated Wizard of Oz may have the pictures in full-colour, but the colour plates are in 1 whole place, in the middle of the book, and that goes the same for the recent Dover Edition of the Wonderful Wizard of Oz (where Dorothy is wearing a pink dress, talking to her friends, all wearing the Green glasses). The other Dover editions of this story have the pictures in black-and-white (sometimes all, other times, a few of them) with the colour-plates in their own chapter but in black-and-white.THIS EDITION - the 100th Anniversary Edition - is one everybody should have. It has all the pictures in colour-and-black lined with the FULL-COLOUR-Plates in their OWN PROPER CHAPTER place, e.g. ""She caught Toto by the ear"" in THE CYCLONE, ""I am the Witch of the North"" in THE COUNCIL WITH THE MUNCHKINS, etc. It even has the picture of Dorothy and Toto back in Kansas on the very final page on the book in the backboard. And when you pull off this picture-cover (the one that you see now), the actual cardboard-leather-bound cover has the EXACT SAME ORIGINAL Cover Angela Lansbury shows in ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: The Making of a Movie Classic"", where the Cowardly Lion is wearing the Green glasses on the Front cover, Toto is on the spine and the back has the faces of Dorothy, the Scarecrow and (Nick chopper) the Tin Woodman in circles.An Important Note on this story is that it Is Imaginative But it Is Not DARK as some people say. It is not scary nor is it supposed to be attempted that way in any new adaptation, nor should it always be made similar to MGM with constant references or musical scenes. This is an AMERICAN 1900 Story, it is not English/British like J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter, Tolkien's Hobbit/LofR or C. S. Lewis' Narnia - it is its own place!! Oz is a place where animals can talk, there are strange animals who are not mythical and never appeared in any other legends, wicked people are defeated by simple acts, by it accidentally-non-magical or magical, everybody is friends and the ordinary items of our world can have strong but simple magic.Now matter how much the MGM Musical is loved, reading this book is worth it, because it explains how many of the events in Oz came to be when Dorothy arrived: how did the Tin Woodman come to be? How did and why do the Winged Monkeys obey the Wicked Witch of the West? What became of the Winkies after the WWWitch's death? Did Lion become the King of Beasts again? Naturally the musical is different from the book, but despite the change of the Kansas beginning/ending, the story is basically the same. this book only offers MORE than the movie did.Hope you enjoyed my descriptive review. Watch out for my other Oz and Digimon reviews (by Sam A. Milazzo).",1
Losing Faith in Faith: From Preacher to Atheist,A former preacher tell why he abandoned the guidance of the Bible to follow the dictates of own conscience.,['Dan Barker'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-xgvAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=-xgvAAAAYAAJ&q=Losing+Faith+in+Faith:+From+Preacher+to+Atheist&dq=Losing+Faith+in+Faith:+From+Preacher+to+Atheist&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Freedom from Religion Fndtn,2006,http://books.google.com/books?id=-xgvAAAAYAAJ&dq=Losing+Faith+in+Faith:+From+Preacher+to+Atheist&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],9.0,1877733075,,A34LFXUT728M1W,"Gilker Kimmel ""Gilker""",98/104,5.0,964137600,Excellent book for the X-tian,"Looking at some of the other reviews, it's obvious that this book polarizes readers, being rated either very highly or very poorly. I'm not surprised. The high ratings are to be expected - there's a real shortage of good quality material for former Christians. That, too, is understandable since America frowns so mightily on unbelievers. That brings us to the negative reviews, frowning mightily.Personally, I appreciate Barker very deeply. I came to the same conclusions via a slightly different path. I was also a devout Christian, though never a preacher. I was Washed in the Blood of the Lamb at 16, Sanctified and Born Again. I had a personal friend in Jesus. I also had a thirst for understanding, so I studied the Bible for years and took everything to the Lord in prayer. I studied and prayed until one day I realized that I didn't believe anymore.No tragedy; no rebellion; just realization.It was only after I came to grips with this change in worldview that I came to understand just how much Christianity warps a person's thinking, denigrating reason and elevating faith. It's been a long climb up from the muck, but it's great to be clean now. Christians reading that will be as outraged by the thought as they would be by reading Barker's book. Former Christians know precisely what I'm talking about.This is an excellent book for recovering Christian.",1
"The China Study: The Most Comprehensive Study of Nutrition Ever Conducted and the Startling Implications for Diet, Weight Loss and Long-term Health",,,,,,,,,,1932100385,16.47,A1J80IPBUGPMQF,F. Tyler B. Brown,98/104,5.0,1326672000,Ideological Heart of the Bill Clinton Diet,"Due to recent publicity from Bill Clinton's post-surgery dietary changes, and the recent release of the film,Forks Over Knives, this 2006 book is benefitting from a resurgence of attention. After reading this book, I could only think- I wish I had found this book sooner.I have read a lot of books on food, diet, and nutrition- and almost always they have left me disappointed. I find nutrition books are either focused only on one food type or nutrient, or push some gimmicky diet (a la the Atkins Diet), or are too esoteric and free from any grounding in sound science, or are mind-numbingly boring and poorly written.This book from Dr. Colin Campbell is none of those things. ""The China Study"" takes a macro, bird's eye view of what we eat. For example, Campbell writes, ""As you shall see, considering how networks of chemicals behave instead of isolated single chemicals is far more meaningful."" This book is an attempt to look at the whole picture. As Campbell writes, ""This is the story of how food can change our lives."" Indeed it is.Dr. Campbell, in this book, espouses a whole food, plant-based diet. He very intentionally does not refer to the diet he encourages as ""vegan"", due to the politically charged nature of that word, and because he is not strictly-speaking a vegan. This book is entirely apolitical. Its author makes it clear that his motivation for his dietary behaviors is purely health, not to protect animals or be a steward of the environment (although the latter he does mention as a bonus implication of his choices).Dr. Campbell begins his book, in the chapter ""House of Proteins"" laying out a convincing argument of why animal-based proteins (particularly casein, the protein found in cow's milk) are harmful to the body. To support his thesis, Dr. Campbell falls back on his life of research (most notable of which is ""The China Study"", which Chou EnLai, the Premier of China in the early 1970s funded when he was dying of cancer. It is the largest and most comprehensive demographic study ever conducted that looks at what people eat and their levels of general health. Dr. Campbell was one of the team of researchers appointed to conduct this study.)Dr. Campbell never stretches the findings of his studies too far, and is quick to make clear that the correlations found in his studies does not necessarily mean causation- that is, just because populations that consume more animal fats and animal-based proteins have high incidences of ""diseases of affluence"" (cancer, heart disease, stroke) does not mean that these proteins cause such diseases. But the combination of the correlations, with the clear and powerful way that Dr. Campbell outlines his observations of how animal-based proteins can disrupt some of the body's most essential organic processes, allows one to comfortably make a strong probabilistic guess that these type of foods are best eliminated from one's diet.After Dr. Campbell outlines the various diseases, their possible relationships with animal-based proteins, he arrives at suggestions in the chapters ""Eating Right: Eight Principles of Food and Health"" and ""How to Eat.""From there Dr. Campbell answers the question that surely so many readers will have through the first half of the book, which is, ""If you're right, Dr. Campbell, why am I just hearing about this stuff now?"" In the chapter ""Science: the Dark Side"", Dr. Campbell outlines how the food industry (of which his parents, ironically, were a part- they were dairy farmers) and government agencies (some of which he used to sit on- and with which he has firsthand experience interacting) are compromised, and are not sources of sound nutritional advice. Dr. Campbell outlines the way in which powerful corporations with clear monetary interests fund these boards. It is a blatant conflict of interest that has profound implications on how and what our country eats.The other convincing case that Dr. Campbell makes for why you do not hear his argument in the mainstream dialogue is the fact that hospital networks, who can derive up to 65% of their income from heart-related surgeries and medicines, and who employ surgeons who are faced with mountains of debt from years of study and who stand to make gobs of money from conducting surgeries, are not ready or willing to adopt preventive approaches to heart disease.Dr. Campbell cites the case of surgeon Dr. Esselstyn, who proposed to the Cleveland Clinic a preventive ""arrest and reversal"" nutrition program for heart disease patients as a first step before surgery. The hospital said they had no interest in such a program according to Dr. Campbell; and yet, some of the trustees and surgeons of the very same hospital would send their own wives and children to Dr. Esselstyn for his nutritional advice. Clearly, these were people who believed in the preventative power of Dr. Esselstyn's advice, but who also had interests so entrenched that it was easier for them to maintain the status quo than adopt Dr. Esselstyn's more preventative approach.Dr. Campbell in the chapter ""Scientific Reductionism"" attacks the micro focus of research that simply looks at individual nutrients and vitamins. He demonstrates how the recommendations of groups like ""National Academy of Sciences Diet, Nutrition, and Cancer Committee"" only ""apply to foods as sources of nutrients- not to dietary supplements of individual nutrients."" Dr. Campbell vehemently opposes the notion that ""`specific components of the diet can be modified' to the benefit of one's health."" He argues that foods like lean pork meat or fat free milk are an absurd notion that ignores the macro implications of available research: that the mere presence of animal-based proteins in your diet has the potential to disrupt important biological processes in the body, and that these harmful consequences cannot be avoided through the modification of animal proteins, but only through the elimination of them entirely from the diet.As I noted in a review of the film,Forks Over Knives, the central thesis of this book is communicated in that work too, and something is even gained through the medium of film. Although, one should not, I believe, watch the film in light of reading the book, but rather should watch it in addition to reading this book. There is much to be gained from reading this book, from absorbing Dr. Campbell's thesis as he clearly and powerfully lays it out step-by-step.That President Clinton's adoption of Dr. Campbell's whole food, plant-based diet has given this book a revival that it so deserves, I am forever grateful. That the former President had the choice of the best medical advice money can buy, and that he ultimately decided to follow a path Dr. Campbell sets out in this book, no longer surprises me. For anyone concerned with how what we eat impacts how we feel and how we live our life, for anyone struggling with, or at risk of: cancer, diabetes, heart disease, high cholesterol, obesity- I highly recommend this book. There may be a large portion of this book that you do not agree with, which is fine. Regardless of how much of this book you agree with, there will be at least morsels of sound science, delivered in a distilled, comprehensible style that you will be able to absorb, implement in your life, and benefit from.",1

A better word for A Portrait is impressionistic. Joyce is more concerned with giving the reader an impression of Stephen's experience than with emptying the contents of his head. What's confusing is the style mirrors the way Stephen interprets his experiences at the time, according to the level of his mental development.When Stephen is a baby, you get only what comes in through the five senses. When he is a young boy, you get the experience refracted through a prism of many things: his illness (for those who've read Ulysses, here is the beginning of Stephen's hydrophobia - ""How cold and slimy the water had been! A fellow had once seen a big rat jump into the scum.""), his poor eyesight, the radically mixed signals he's been given about religion and politics (the Christmas meal), his unfair punishment, and maybe most important of all, his father's unusual expressions (growing up with phrases like, ""There's more cunning in one of those warts on his bald head than in a pack of jack foxes"" how could this kid become anything but a writer?)It is crucial to understand that Stephen's experiences are being given a certain inflection in this way when you come to the middle of the book and the sermon. You have to remember that Stephen has been far from a good Catholic boy. Among other things, he's been visting the brothels! The sermon hits him with a special intensity, so much so that it changes his life forever. Before it he's completely absorbed in the physical: food, sex, etc. After it he becomes just as absorbed in the spiritual/aesthetic world. It's the sermon that really puts him on the track to becoming an artist. One reviewer called the sermon overwrought. Well, of course it's overwrought. That's the whole point. Read it with your sense of humor turned on and keep in mind that you're getting the sermon the way you get everything else in the book: through Stephen.After Stephen decides he doesn't want to be a priest, the idea of becoming an artist really starts to take hold. And when he sees the girl on the beach, his life is set for good. That scene has to be one of the most beautiful in all of literature. After that, Stephen develops his theory of esthetics with the help of Aristotle and Aquinas and we find ourselves moving from one conversation to another not unlike in Plato (each conversation with the appropriate inflection of college boy pomposity). In the end, Stephen asks his ""father"" to support him as he goes into the real world to create something. I like to think that this is an echo of the very first line in the book. The father, in one of many senses, is the moocow story. The story gave birth to Stephen's imagination and now it's the son's turn to create.This is such a rich and beautiful book. I suppose it's possible for people to ""get it"" and still not like it, but I really think if you read and re-read, and maybe do a little research, the book will open up to you the way it did to me.",0

I was recently on a flight and sat next to a guy in his early 20s who sat there fascinated, reading it during the entire 3 hour flight.Gangs of New York is NOT your typical book on which a movie is based. If it's bought by someone who loves the film somebody is going to be in for a monster surprise (or disappointment). Don't expect a plot, don't expect compelling writing, don't expect a large section on which the book is based and to easily find those sections. But do expect to be fascinated.WHAT THIS IS: This is a book about: early brutal gang warfare, during a time in the 19th century where gangs literally swarmed all over New York City; blow-by-blow bloody battles and legendary gang fighters in a city virtually in the grip of gangs -- leading to the creation of the NY City Police department; and the politically dominating Tammany Hall machine's birth and growth in the 19th and 20th centuries, set within the context of a politically corrupt, violence-prone city.Most interestingly, it's about a time in NYC's history that you seldom see portrayed in films or in books. I found the accounts of the 1863 Civil War draft riots absolutely gripping. But mostly it's about the gangs with names such as Dead Rabbits, Plug Uglies etc (the film used these names too). Many illustrations are old-style drawings rather than photos.WHAT IT DOES: Gangs of New York gives you a good history seemingly based on interviews and mountains of old newspaper clippings, most of it in anecdotal versus dry statistical form.WHAT IT IS NOT: It is not a book written in a modern prose style, but it isn't boring. It doesn't have a ""plot"" with a beginning, middle and end. No, it doesn't have a hero, or anyone resembling Leonardo, a love subplot, etc.But if you're interested in the acclaimed movie's source material and learning about a fascinating and often forgotten period in NY City's municipal history you'll love it. Even though it was out of print for many years The Gangs of New York has been a legend itself for many years -- and it easy to see why.",1

It's the sermon that really puts him on the track to becoming an artist. One reviewer called the sermon overwrought. Well, of course it's overwrought. That's the whole point. Read it with your sense of humor turned on and keep in mind that you're getting the sermon the way you get everything else in the book: through Stephen.After Stephen decides he doesn't want to be a priest, the idea of becoming an artist really starts to take hold. And when he sees the girl on the beach, his life is set for good. That scene has to be one of the most beautiful in all of literature. After that, Stephen develops his theory of esthetics with the help of Aristotle and Aquinas and we find ourselves moving from one conversation to another not unlike in Plato (each conversation with the appropriate inflection of college boy pomposity). In the end, Stephen asks his ""father"" to support him as he goes into the real world to create something. I like to think that this is an echo of the very first line in the book. The father, in one of many senses, is the moocow story. The story gave birth to Stephen's imagination and now it's the son's turn to create.This is such a rich and beautiful book. I suppose it's possible for people to ""get it"" and still not like it, but I really think if you read and re-read, and maybe do a little research, the book will open up to you the way it did to me.",0

This is a wonderful way to learn of hatha yoga's roots as a holistic system, and even put it into practice, since this book is a modern compilation of ancient Indian lesson-texts put into modern English. Hatha Yoga Pradipika means ""Light on Hatha Yoga"" (not to be confused with modern and lesser imitations that use that title). Holding this book in my hands feels like direct access to a rich history of the roots of hatha unscathed by ""new age"" ideas. Basically the book is about classical postures, breath control, and cleansing.Interestingly, the book does not talk about food intake--basically says that it is not important to spend too much time thinking about what food to eat, how much, etc. (this is a nice change in a modern world that obsesses over food). However, it does go into length on the subject of cleansing the body using several methods, some of which are extreme, but some of which a novice could do with some courage.Another interesting thing about the texts in this book is that although they are traditional, the focus isn't spent on spiritual concepts such as chakras, kundalini, or meditation, etc, it even rarely mentions relatively popular yoga terms such as prana or nadis. As it is well-known about hatha, the people who practiced these ancient rituals believed that persons could not reach enlightenment through stillness and meditation, but instead, through physical asana and purification. There are interesting and clear ideas concerning this inside the book as well.",1

William Thackery's historical fiction HENRY ESMOND and not VANITY FAIR was regarded by his contemporaries as his finest work, and it was routine for writers like Dickens in A TALE OF TWO CITIES and Tolstoy in WAR AND PEACE to write novels set in a different historical period. In the twentieth century, however, as novelists began more often to fictionalize their own experiences and focus on the psychological make up of their characters and historian forged a more rigorously scientific form of historical research, historical fiction suffered a sharp decrease in critical respect. To be sure, there were exceptions, whether Robert Graves writing about the Roman emperors in I, CLAUDIUS and CLAUDIUS THE GOD or in Patrick O'Brian's superb series of novels about the Royal Navy at the time of the Napoleonic Wars. But these were exceptions and not the rule and even O'Brian garnered less respect than he would have in the 19th century. All of this is to explain why Gore Vidal's superb series of novels that he calls Narratives of Empire have failed to achieve as much acclaim, as they deserve.LINCOLN is in essence exceptionally accurate history encapsulated in the form of a novel. I have read a spate of books on Lincoln and the Civil War and I was almost never able to fault his scholarship. In a note following the conclusion of the novel he indicates that the manuscript was seen--and corrected--by no less an authority on Lincoln than David Herbert Donald, who is arguably the supreme authority on Lincoln of this age. But accuracy would be an empty thing if the narrative were not enlivened by Vidal's remarkable skills as a writer. He has a fascinating style, moving without transition from a scene with one group of characters at one point of time in one paragraph to another group at another time in the next. The narrative fairly races along.This is not a novelistic retelling of the entirety of Lincoln's life, but focuses instead exclusively on the period of his presidency. The story begins with Lincoln's arrival in Washington and ends shortly after his assassination. In fact, the subject matter is almost precisely the same as that covered by Doris Kearns Goodwin in her new book TEAM OF RIVALS: THE POLITICAL GENIUS OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN. The story Vidal wants to highlight is how Lincoln managed to hold together the Union despite widespread opposition to the War in the North and a cabinet that on the one hand imagined him to be a weak leader whom they could easily control and on the other filled with individuals who possessed presidential aspirations of their own. Interestingly, the two finest demonstrations of Lincoln's leadership skills come not from the work of historians, but by novelists: Vidal here and Shelby Foote in his depiction of Lincoln's extraordinary skills in his three-volume THE CIVIL WAR.Though he is astonishingly faithful to the historical record, Vidal's greatest achievement is bringing to life in credible fashion a number of remarkable personalities in ways that are consistent with the historical record. In reading about the war, I had of course read about Seward and Chase, but neither truly emerged as vivid personalities before. Perhaps their biographers would disagree with the portraits Vidal paints, but for me whenever I read about either individual in the future, I will almost certainly do so through eyes of Vidal.We live in an age that is obsessed with the notion of ""political bias,"" an idea whose importance is, I think, outrageously overstated. One either is faithful to the facts or not and your bias might make you lean one way or another, but it won't allow you to distort the facts unless you are being deliberately dishonest (I think of Ann Coulter's almost macabre depiction of Joseph McCarthy in her writing). But given Vidal's well-known adherence to New Deal ideals, a word or two might be in order. I was surprised at how politically evenhanded this book was. In fact, if anything Vidal mutes the widespread belief of more contemporary Civil War historians that the conflict was overwhelmingly about slavery and instead presents the idea that it was more about states's rights (an idea that has been more and more discredited not merely by folks like James McPherson but Southern historians such as Shelby Foote). Actually, this is Vidal's New Deal point of view coming forth, as previous generations sought to not offend Southern politicians by intimating the war was about the admittedly (today, that is) disgusting institution of slavery, which no one would defend, so much as it was about states's rights, which is, while wrong, not so outrageously indefensible. In the New Deal, the Democratic Party functioned as an uneasy coalition of various groups, including labor, Northern progressives, and Southern populists. With the Nixon strategy, the South has split off from the Democratic party (initially over civil rights issues) and those on the left have been more comfortable in speaking of the Civil War and its causes in more historically accurate terms. I am, by the way, a Southerner, even if I today live in the Land of Lincoln, so I see this issues from both sides.I recommend this novel in the strongest possible terms. It is not just a very fine novel: it is a great way to internalize history in a way that is rarely as possible in a straightforward historical account. Moreover, it is a richly complex Lincoln that is presented here. In contrast to the blandly hagiographic portrait by Carl Sandburg, this is a warts and all version. Lincoln isn't idealized, but is shown with both his virtues and vices, from his astonishing ability to handle people who imagined that they were handling him, to his self-proclaimed ignorance of financial matters. But he is more the admirable for his portrayal as a believable, flesh and blood human being, instead of mere statue.",1

I won't go into details (you can find them easily on the net) but essentially the cut down version is not written in Heinlein's ""voice"" but drastically cut down (by RAH) to fit into a length the publisher thought proper.And so it does not sound like any other Heinlein novel, and this has split the ""Stranger"" camp right down the middle. There are those to whom the original book was bible -- and those tend not to like other Heinlein works. Those of us who love Heinlein have always felt kind of ""meh"" about Stranger... until the uncut version was released (in 1991).Now, the Kindle version being sold is the cut version, so if you were a fan of that (published in 1961) you'll love this version. However, if you are not a huge fan of that version I would stay away from this Kindle version at all costs (there are easily found web versions of the uncut novel -- I'm not advocating piracy, but it's unlikely we'll ever see a Kindle uncut version as Amazon seems clueless here -- even official reviewers seem to think this version is uncut, but I can promise you it isn't, as the passages are clear and easy to find in even the sample version).One last thing -- if you have read the cut version (either this Kindle version or otherwise) you might want to give the uncut version a try.

In the mysterious creepy corridors of the dungeon your quest continues against the evil forces that oppose you. Your daring efforts to reach the Red Dragon's Lair are where your adventure begins and Your Quest Awaits!The evil Red Dragon lives deep within a dungeon filled with undead monsters and elementals. Your goal is to clear the dungeon of evil and slay the Red Dragon. Together you and the other players join together looting monsters and plundering the dungeon in search of magical items and weapons!This game is a character driven game, which uses both cards and dice to deal with the many obstacles within the dungeon and the Red Dragon's Lair. Players choose a character deck at the beginning of the game then equip their special items and weapons. Each character is unique and uses different styles of play. The crafty Rogue hides in the shadows firing arrows from a distance. The Paladin engages the monsters head-on with shield and sword. The Warrior jumps in the fray without regard for himself slaying monsters near and far. And the Magician uses powerful magic to protect the others and destroy monsters! The awesome forces that oppose you can prove to be more than a match and adventurers will die! Mwahahahaha!I have always loved adventuring and battling monsters. Throughout my life I have played many amazing games both video and table top; D&D, Dragon's Lair, Ultima Online, Gauntlet Legends, WOW, Skyrim, H.A.C.K. , and Zogar's Gaze.

It is built around the classic concept of building a character, and then exploring a dungeon with no means of escape until every threat has been vanquished. That is the foundation of The Red Dragon's Lair, and each and every encounter will immerse you in that genre. You can customize the dungeon by adding or removing certain cards!

Yea, but wait awhile.","In the wake of the new D&amp;D rules, Wizards has released this(it appears) first supplement that uses the 3rd edition rules for the popular Forgotten Realms world. There are good and bad things; bearing in mind that(to me) the jury is still out as to whether 3rd Edition is wholly successful.First, the good. The story is an adventure in which the PC heroes will get to revisit a war-ravaged Cormyr in the wake of King Azoun's death. It is a good game line involving loyalty and betrayal, and ceratinly it tries to add to both the Realms gameworld's history and supplement the novel, Death of the Dragon, from which it is based. If you are planning on reading that novel, some spoilers are revealed here! The tale varies from some traditional, Realms fare by providing a distinct,but open storyline to follow. It gives minor side treks to enhance the main story, but also generates numerous foes of various levels to face the heroes. In keeping with Wizards of the Coast &quot;new&quot; approach to Forgotten Realms, Reynolds and Miller have kept more powerful, noted luminaries away(like Alusair, and Vangerdahast) and left the adventurers on their own with a basic mission.Beyond the developing storyline, they have also managed to do a good job of forming the adventure to the new rules and concepts. For hardline gamers, some of these rules will seem unconventional with the game world, but a little speculation and thought will make them clear. Most importantly, the module tries to emphasize the action over the rules. This is valuable, given that there won't be an official Realms book translating and customizing the 3rd Edition rules until next year! It should have made it possible for old and new players to join in the game as it is set.Now the bad. In spite of the fine 3rd Edition design, there is some perception here that this was reconfigured mid-stream from the older rules. The rules' framework seem skeletal, at times, on what to do, plus there is very little supplemental material to help in the transition to a 3rd Edition Realms game. Case in point, the priest conversion for Torilian gods are limited to 7 of them! This isn't very much given that in previous Realms material(Faiths &amp; Avatars, etc.)there are probably around 50 unique beings characters can choose from. This wouldn't be so bad if, like other new 3rd Edition modules, this was a 1st or 2nd level adventure to get you used to the system. But this is intended for 10th Level players!If you are new player, this makes it daunting to try an play advanced character in a new system without all the details or experience. If you are an older player, this means placing your current, likely 2nd Edition, characters through a conversion to the new rules, but lacking all the materials to make them Realmsian players. Clearly, more information would have been helpful to supplment. The assurance that you can make your own designs until the new Forgotten Realms release, and then &quot;tinker&quot; to match these impending new rules isn't comforting if you play with the your &quot;home-made&quot; changes for nearly year and then discover you are all wrong! However, I also realize that it would have bulked up the module beyond its design(plus been costly)!Besides this awareness, I mention two other things. First is that some your opponents are rather daunting for this offering(given that the idea is to make it 4 10th level characters), especially Mahrlee's Raiders and their Blue Dragon ally! Second, the goblin city of Grodd is a great idea and is well developed, but given the implied urgency(to beat rival foes to the hoard) at this point in the adventure, I was surprised that it is left so open-ended for exploration. Ideas are given on how the characters could explore the city, but it stated that no guidance should be given to keep the characters moving along. Neither of these things are serious flaws, but they do generate some frustration if your are trying to maintain a consistent story.So to wrap up: A great story and unique characters in the style Forgotten Realms fans will enjoy, but it lacks some foundations in terms of coping with 3rd Edition rules and higher level play. In a way, maybe Wizards of the Coast should have made it the &quot;last&quot; 2nd Edition module and waited to start the Realms anew next year. Long-time Forgotten Realms fans and gamers can probably adjust to their style of play, but newer fans or those committed to using pure 3rd edition rules will have to be flexible and follow your books well. I don't think you can pick it up and go. Maybe wait until next year to order it, when the new Realms sourcebook arrives in town. In the meantime, enjoy the new, Greyhawk-based ones to wet your feet!",1
A Symphony in the Brain - The Evolution of the New Brain Wave Biofeedback,"A “fascinating overview” of neurofeedback and its potential benefits for treating depression, autism, epilepsy, and other conditions (Discover). Since A Symphony in the Brain was first published, the scientific understanding of our bodies, brains, and minds has taken remarkable leaps. From neurofeedback with functional magnetic resonance imaging equipment, to the use of radio waves, to biofeedback of the heart and breath and coverage of biofeedback by health insurance plans, this expanded and updated edition of the groundbreaking book traces the fascinating untold story of the development of biofeedback. Discovered by a small corps of research scientists, this alternative treatment allows a patient to see real-time measurements of their bodily processes. Its advocates claim biofeedback can treat epilepsy, autism, attention deficit disorder, addictions, and depression with no drugs or side effects; bring patients out of vegetative states; and even improve golf scores or an opera singer’s voice. But biofeedback has faced battles for acceptance in the conservative medical world despite positive signs that it could revolutionize the way a diverse range of medical and psychological problems are treated. Offering case studies, accessible scientific explanations, and dramatic personal accounts, this book explores the possibilities for the future of our health. “Robbins details the fascinating medical history of the therapy, tracing it back to French physician Paul Broca’s discovery of the region in the brain where speech originates. At the heart of this riveting story are the people whose lives have been transformed by neurofeedback, from the doctors and psychologists who employ it to the patients who have undergone treatment.” —Publishers Weekly",['Jim Robbins'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4xHnBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=4xHnBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=A+Symphony+in+the+Brain+-+The+Evolution+of+the+New+Brain+Wave+Biofeedback&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Open Road + Grove/Atlantic,2014-10-03,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4xHnBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Medical'],1.0,B000GTRH1U,,A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ,"Donald Mitchell ""Jesus Loves You!""",98/103,5.0,966643200,More Harmonic Brain Functioning,"I became interested in this book from the perspective of a long-term meditator. I have read many many studies of how meditation improves brain wave patterns, and provides many psychological and physiological benefits. So I was curious about what neurofeedback could do. This book provided an excellent, complete review of the subject. I highly recommend that you study it.Neurofeedback is based on a variety of methods, but they all include giving a person positive and negative reinforcement about their brain wave patterns at different frequencies. Based on clinical experiences, some brain wave patterns provide more calmness, while others provide more clarity, while others encourage creativity. The field has built up based on trial and error beginning with insights from animal research, often done with cats. Often, this treatment is combined with psychological counseling and behavioral reinforcements of other types. Sometimes dietary imbalances that affect brain chemistry are addressed, as well. How neurofeedback treatment is administered depends on the practitioner. There is no government licensing or certification in the field. Many types of equipment are used. Some even allow you to do the treatment on your own at home, with an investment as low as $950. The experience and skill of the practitioner seem to add value though.This field should be distinguished from biofeedback. That process (which is also unlicensed and unregulated for practitioners) focuses on giving patients feedback on things like how warm their hands are, primarily as a mechanism to help people reduce stress. Cold hands can be one sign of stress. By learning to induce more relaxed states, many patients improve from various psychological ailments that involve excess stress. Neurofeedback measures the brain waves themselves (that which directs the body) rather than the outcome of the brain waves (what the body is doing).The book details many interesting cases of great improvement in Attention Deficit Disorder and its near cousin, AHDH (which includes hyperactivity), alcoholism, epilepsy, depression, autism, and high performance (such as opera singing). Each one seems to require a different application of neurofeedback, and is specialized in by different practitioners. One of the encouraging things about the book is a complete list of research reports, descriptions of which practitioners treat which areas, and ways to get more information from web sites and manufacturers. The author also tried neurofeedback and reports his positive and negative experiences. He also looked for failures, and describes those.The main drawback of neurofeedback is that it developed outside of the medical community, so a full set of definitive studies of it remain to be done. So far, NIH has not sponsored any research in this area although it has received grant applications. My own impression is that this would be a good area for NIH to sponsor research in. If efficacy is established, many more researchers would become involved and the field would improve more rapidly. If the process cannot be proven to be effective in double-blind tests (properly designed), then people should stop wasting their time and money and move on to something that works better. To me, the combination of promising results of flawed research and the anecdotal evidence suggests that the $10 million to find out more would be well worth the price. For this therapy is relatively inexpensive, and shows promise even in reducing recurrence of criminal behavior among inmates. If this therapy works, we will save a whole lot on drugs, incarceration, education, and wasted lives.Read this book and see what you think. I certainly identified two people who I think might be good candidates for neurofeedback who aren't doing well with medication and psychiatric help. Perhaps this is what they need. It's certainly worth the money to me to find out.While you are reading this book, also think about our disbelief stall about the way things work. For decades, we treated stomach ulcers with surgery, stomach lining drinks, and acid-production inhibitors. All helped. For the same decades, some scientists believed that these ulcers were caused by stomach infections of the lining. These scientists were right, and now that's the way most ulcers are treated, and quickly and inexpensively cured. Can it be that we have been discouraging another way of thinking that could help us again? It's certainly possible.",1
New Glucose Revolution Guide to Living Well with PCOS,"PCOS—Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome—is the most common hormonal disorder among women of child-bearing age, affecting approximately 6 to 10 percent of premenopausal women.

The authors have taught me that losing weight doesn't have to be the main focus, increasing insulin sensitivity is the focus and then everything else follows. They also say that if you exercise but still don't lose weight you are still increasing your insulin sensitivity and therefore reducing symptoms, which I think is a great motivator. The only thing I feel this book misses out is the importance of organic food for health, but apart from that I feel it imparts a sense of optimism and empowerment for PCOS sufferers.

Their Eyes Were Watching God,"Their Eyes Were Watching God is a 1937 novel by African-American writer Zora Neale Hurston. It is considered a classic of the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s, and it is likely Hurston's best known work.",['Zora Neale Hurston'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cmLrDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=cmLrDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Their+Eyes+Were+Watching+God&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Prabhat Prakashan,2020-05-30,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cmLrDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Reference'],,079104520X,,A1IU7S4HCK1XK0,Joanna Daneman,98/102,5.0,1192579200,"An American Masterpiece, well worth reading","""Their Eyes were Watching God"" has been variously described as feminist literature (though written in 1930), African-American literature (though the story is about people, first and foremost, and race is secondary to the novel) and as a lost masterpiece. It's a lost masterpiece. Thanks to Alice Walker and Oprah Winfrey, the book was brought back to the public's attention.One of the issues with reading Hurston's novel is that it's written in dialect--in Hurston's rendition of how Southern Florida black dialect could be spelled out to her. So reading the book is a bit slow; you have to sound out the words in your mind. If this is a problem, then I'd suggest you listen to the book on tape (ably performed by Ruby Dee) and then read the book afterwards.The story has barely a plot; Janey is a young woman whose grandmother was born in slavery. Her aspirations are no further than the front porch; to live in comfort means being simply able to sit, to sit on the porch and not be in constant motion, working every hour of every day for bare subsistence. She finds an older, established husband for Janey and insists she marry. Janey, then, has a life where, with reasonable work, she can fill her belly and sleep in shelter. Her life is not much better than that of a well-cared-for mule.One day, Janey runs off with Jody Starks, a man of means who charms her with his worldy ways. This is a man going places. And they do go places; to Eatonville, a town that was chartered as an African-American community. Starks sees opportunity in every corner of dusty Eatonville, buys land, builds a store and a house and installs the beautiful Janey as a symbol of his mastery.As Mayor, Starks has appearances to keep up. He has Janey stay in the house or work in the store, and when in the store, she is to keep her head covered. Janey has a wealth of long abundant hair, which Hurston uses as a symbol of life. Janey's hair is flowing and startling; men covet it. As the hair is covered, so is every enjoyment and thought Janey has. She chafes for 20 years under Stark's restrictive rules.The scene where the ""town mule""--a mule freed by Starks from an abusive owner and that became a sort of mascot, dies and is buried in the swamp is exceptional writing, worthy of Mark Twain. The mule is eulogized (by Stark, standing at one point on the mule as podium) and then abandoned to the waiting buzzards. The following scene where the buzzards arrive to do their undertaking is a flight of fancy that is hardly equalled in American literature. All along the book, Hurston takes smaller flights of language; her descriptions sometimes soar, or are humorous or completely imaginative.Janey runs off after Stark's death with ""Tea Cake""--a younger man. While her first two marriages were for the sustenance of the body (food, shelter, comfort, a home) this marriage is for the sustenance of the soul. Tea Cake plays guitar, plays games, dances, gambles, sings and flirts. Hurston is too clever to make him perfect; he hurts Janey, as only someone who loves another person can hurt them, and he is a bit of a cad, yet he brings out something in Janey that no life of pure material wealth could do--freedom and sensuality and joy. The culmination of the story is rather contrived, but still, the completion of the three marriages tells almost a fable-like story of a quest for personal growth. Janey comes home to Eatonville, and tells her story to Phoeby, her friend. The rest of the tale is up to us to fill in.Sometimes the writing reminds me of Virginia Woolf--the interior dialog and mood of the character is the action as much or more than the action happening on the story's stage. Sometimes Hurston reminds me of Twain in her delving into the linguistic richness and uniqueness of Floridian life. Her education as a folklorist sharpened her ear, but her deep honesty into the interior life of women is what makes this story so great. It's definitely one of the top American novels and deserves to be read.",1
Psycho-Cybernetics,"Cybernetics (loosely translated from the Greek): “a helmsman who steers his ship to port.” Psycho-Cybernetics is a term coined by Dr. Maxwell Maltz, which means, “steering your mind to a productive, useful goal so you can reach the greatest port in the world, peace of mind.” Since its first publication in 1960, Maltz’s landmark bestseller has inspired and enhanced the lives of more than 30 million readers. In this updated edition, with a new introduction and editorial commentary by Matt Furey, president of the Psycho-Cybernetics Foundation, the original text has been annotated and amplified to make Maltz’s message even more relevant for the contemporary reader. “Before the mind can work efficiently, we must develop our perception of the outcomes we expect to reach. Maxwell Maltz calls this Psycho-Cybernetics; when the mind has a defined target it can focus and direct and refocus and redirect until it reaches its intended goal.” —Tony Robbins (from Unlimited Power) Maltz was the first researcher and author to explain how the self-image (a term he popularized) has complete control over an individual’s ability to achieve (or fail to achieve) any goal. And he developed techniques for improving and managing self-image—visualization, mental rehearsal, relaxation—which have informed and inspired countless motivational gurus, sports psychologists, and self-help practitioners for more than fifty years. The teachings of Psycho-Cybernetics are timeless because they are based on solid science and provide a prescription for thinking and acting that lead to quantifiable results.",['Maxwell Maltz'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hJpPEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=hJpPEAAAQBAJ&dq=Psycho-Cybernetics&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin,2015-11-03,http://books.google.com/books?id=hJpPEAAAQBAJ&dq=Psycho-Cybernetics&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Self-Help'],,B000GWFCL4,,A2VWGDZBAMFCHA,K.

How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel,"Presents a study of Marcel Proust that combines elements of literary biography, textual analysis, and self-help manual as it examines the French writer's thoughts on true love, vacations, dating, and other issues",['Alain De Botton'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_fAFEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=_fAFEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=How+Proust+Can+Change+Your+Life:+Not+a+Novel&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Vintage,1998,http://books.google.com/books?id=_fAFEAAAQBAJ&dq=How+Proust+Can+Change+Your+Life:+Not+a+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],23.0,1572700971,,A1VO8FB3BJLUNI,brassawe,98/102,5.0,956534400,A different self-help approach.,"I have tackled only &quot;Swann's Way&quot; from the seven volumes of Marcel Proust's &quot;In Search of Lost Time,&quot; formerly translated as &quot;Remembrance of Things Past.&quot; You need not have read Proust to thoroughly enjoy this concise 197-page book in nine chapters. When you finish it, however, you will be seriously contemplating having a go at Proust's masterpiece in its entirety.Consider the chapter titles. The fourth is &quot;How to Suffer Successfully.&quot; The seventh is &quot;How to Open Your Eyes.&quot; The eighth is &quot;How to be Happy in Love.&quot; The last, and my favorite, is &quot;How to Put Books Down.&quot; The author draws on the ideas and characters found in Proust's masterpiece and renders Proust's response to these issues. All of this is very wittily done. The whole thing is leavened with fascinating biographical tidbits concerning this strange, brilliant man, Marcel Proust. In that last chapter Mr. de Botton (apparently a Brit) presents us with Proust's view of books and their proper place in life:&quot;It is one of the great and wonderful characteristics of good books (which allows us to see the role at once essential yet limited that reading may play in our spiritual lives) that for the author they may be called &quot;Conclusions&quot; but for the reader &quot;Incitements.&quot; We feel very strongly that our own wisdom begins where that of the author leaves off, and we would like him to provide us with answers when all he is able to do is provide us with desires . . . . That is the value of reading, and also its inadequacy. To make it into a discipline is to give too large a role to what is only an incitement. Reading is on the threshold of the spiritual life; it can introduce us to it: it does not constitute it.&quot;On the other hand should we expect any lesser eloquence from a man who on a different subject said this:&quot;People who are not in love fail to understand how an intelligent man can suffer because of a very ordinary woman. This is like being surprised that anyone should be stricken with cholera because of a creature so insignificant as the comma bacillus.&quot;I loved this book. It was indeed a tonic, and I think you might find it so, too.",1

All of the previous books were so wonderful, but I had been waiting for Gregori's story and was really afraid Ms. Feehan would not be able to pull it off. Boy, was I wrong!First things first - don't read this book if you are expecting a vampire tale a la Ann Rice or even Amanda Ashley - there are elements both of those types of stories in Feehan's books, but they really are their own genre. Vampire purists will not enjoy these stories, but if you like a book heavy on romance and intimacy, with a paranormal twist, you'll absolutely love Feehan. As purely escapist fiction, I rank the Dark series at the top of my list! Very much like J.D. Robb's Death series, these are characters who are larger than life and stories that will have you reading the books over and over.I won't summarize the storyline, because the book reviews have already done it, and the overall plotline really isn't what makes these books anyway. The interplay between Gregori and Savannah is the focus, as each comes to terms with living in the other's world. Gregori rivals Robb's Rourke as male perfection - no woman (or reader) could resist either of them, and it's so moving to read of him finally discovering his emotions again; Savannah is one of Feehan's better heroines, feisty and strong, much like her mother Raven.If you decide to read this series, it really does help to begin with the first book, Dark Prince, and work your way through them in order (Dark Gold was my least favorite, and pretty much could be skipped). It builds familiarity with the characters, and in each of the books you'll find glimpses of all the Carpathians that help flesh out the characters - when you do finally get to Gregori's story, it will be much sweeter for having met him in earlier books.I'm already anxiously awaiting Julian's story in November (the first chapter hints that maybe his lifemate is someone very close to Gregori), and hope Feehan continues the series for a long time.",1
The Dhimmi: Jews and Christians Under Islam,,,,,,,,,,0838632629,,A56PCDBOVXXSR,M. D Roberts,98/102,5.0,1063929600,Disturbing Account Of Religious/Racial Prejudice,"This is a disturbing book which reveals what is described as a socially acceptable Islamic conduct against peoples who were classed as ""inferior"".For the most part the book describes these peoples as Jews and Christians who were classed as ""dhimmi"". ""Dhimmitude"" being further elaborated as the religious, cultural, and political fate of non-Muslims living under Islamic rule, usually when their lands have been subject to Islamic conquest.Where the politicisation/allegations of racial prejudice, segregation, apartheid and indeed genocide have become quite common-place in the Middle East against the Jewish state, a book such as this is very timely in showing another side to the story. A book that reveals the painful, disturbing policy of prejudice, racial hatred and segregation of countless people who the book describes were classed as ""inferior""on the basis of their religion alone.Many examples are referred to in this study and many issues are discussed. The book draws a number of distinctions drawn and prejudices applied upon Jews and Christians who refused to accept and bow to Islam. Just by way of a single example, page 56 of this study deals with the ""Invalidity of the Dhimmi's Oath"".With legal cases being dealt with under Quranic law, every case involving a Muslim and a dhimmi received a ""peculiar"" treatment in that a dhimmi was forbidden to give evidence against a Muslim. The Dhimmi's oath being deemed unacceptable in an Islamic court, which made it virtually impossible for any Muslim opponent to be condemned. To further any defence, the book describes that the dhimmi would be obliged to ""purchase"" Muslim witnesses, often at great expense.This refusal of Muslim religious courts to accept such testimony of the dhimmi being based on hadiths which maintained that the infidels were of a ""perverse and mendacious character because they deliberately persisted in denying the superiority of Islam"". The same law preventing any Muslim from being put to death on account of an infidel.This principle alone is further elaborated in this book with the example of the frequent accusations directed at Jews and Christians of having ""blasphemed"" the Prophet or Islam, an offence punishable by death. In such a case, the dhimmi was clearly in no position to contradict the testimony of a Muslim making the accusation and could therefore only save his life by conversion to Islam. (Although some exceptions have been recorded, this was the abiding principle nearly always adhered to.)This is a classic study of this subject and it is not a ""light"" read, but a subject which demands attention.

It was an interesting class, but I really enjoyed the reading material. At this point, Bean Trees had been around for a couple of years, but I had never heard of it, nor had I heard of Barbara Kingsolver. This novel was so absorbing, I didn't feel it was an assignment at all. I spent a great, warm October weekend sitting on my parents porch and reading this book.I also think that this book has one of the best opening paragraphs in contemporary fiction. I won't give it away, but do yourself a favor and look for it at any bookstore. This novel is funny, sad, and touching.

This is a book that you'll ant to hold onto, to give to friends, to discuss...Taylor Greer is one of the most engaging heroines in literature, and her unconventional story is infused with a real contemporary feel. What does that mean? I just mean that Kingsolver disucsses issues and people that many authors don't in popular american fiction (native american issues, central american politics, refugees, mixed marriages and Protestantism and catholicism all merge in one novel), and as a result, Kingsolver holds up a mirror of our world where we can see ourselves and society much clearer than before.

Firstly, it took a unique perspective. Reports of Treaty meetings, tribal histories, Congressional findings and interview transcripts have all been distilled to provide the Indian point of view. Indeed the books' subtitle is 'An Indian History of the American West'. The second factor has to do with when the book was published. Interest in environmental issues was growing and the accounts of the destruction by the settlers of the Eastern forests, the soiling of the rivers and the slaughter of the Buffalo herds struck a chord, especially when contrasted with the practices of the Indians. Readers began to see Indians in a different light, as the first conservationists.The period of history covered is short. From about 1860 to 1890. The first chapter briefly sketches the interactions between Eupopean and Indians from the formers' arrival in Massachusetts in 1620 up to the setting up of the 'permanent indian frontier' west of the Mississippi in 1847.The 'frontier' lasted no time at all. Gold was discovered, land was sought and settlers flocked west. To cover this in legitimacy it was necessary to invent 'Manifest Destiny'. The Indians were now doomed as history has shown that this policy made it manifest that the Indians were destined to be swept aside by the white man. All that we have left is their legends, their magical placenames and some works like this book that provides insights into how the West was really lost.",0

I recommend it highly.

Lack of an index: (The same is true of the Pronouns and Preposition workbook.) I find it hard to comprehend how a contemporary academic book can be published without an index. There is a tremendous amount of valuable information contained in this book but being limited to the Table of Contents or to ones memory of where a specific item can be found is debilitating. This is a terrible ommission.2. After studying the book thoroughly twice, my workbook is riddled with tabs and annotations in search of clarifications. A bit of addtional clarification and some additional examples before the author goes off into the exercises would potentially eliminate a considerable amount of confusion. The sections on Ser and Estar are a good example. It appears that sufficient explanaions are provided in the book (in the section on Ser for exaple) until one delves into further exercises in subsequent chapters of the book. There, knowledge of the full use of &quot;Ser&quot; is assumed, but referencing back to the original chapeter on &quot;Ser&quot; leaves one empty handed (in some but not all cases) as to why &quot;Ser&quot; was used rather than &quot;Estar.&quot; This might seem picayune until one looks back on the total number of questions raised throughout the book. It is understandable that the author cannot anticipate all possible questions and points of confusion, but a bit more explanation and the use of additional examples would greatly amplify and clarify the grammatical content.3. The student would also benefit greatly by having additional exercises in the book that mix and match what is learned in previous chapters (This is done is a few limited cases.) It is all too easy as an exercise to answer questions and translate text that directly follows the material being presented, for it is customed tailored to the points being made in that exercise. Addtional end of chapter exercise combining all that has been learned would be a valued addition. With that said, let me also add that the translation paragraphs at the end of each section (as humorous and as enjoyable as they are to translate) somewhat satisfy this contention, but not fully.",0

Mastering APA Style: Student's Workbook and Training Guide Fifth Edition,"This guide, updated for use with the fifth edition of the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, is designed to help improve students' understanding and use of APA style before they begin writing, allowing instructors in academic settings to concentrate more on course material and less on correcting errors in students' papers. The resource contains eight multiple-choice assessment surveys, correction keys and answer sheets, along with instructions on how to incorporate this material into a curriculum. The text should also enable editorial trainers to help polish their copy-editors skills as they gain knowledge of APA style and the Publication Manual. Included are style points for references and citations, grammar, headings, serialization, statistical and mathematical copy, italics and capitalization, numbers style, and table formatting. The guide can be used as a learning module for the classroom or for independent study.","['Harold Gelfand', 'Charles J.

She succeeds, but inherits a three-year-old Native American girl named Turtle along the way, and together, from Oklahoma to Arizona, half-Cherokee Taylor and her charge search for a new life in the West.

But in a way, they're the better ones. Especially this one.I won't bother telling the story, because frankly I cannot. Now, I've been reading this book in about monthly intervals for years, but I still find something new each time, and I still have trouble keeping track of the story. Don't let that keep you, though. Yes, it *is* mildly confusing, but it all works out after a couple of times of reading, and it's great fun from first time, page one. Besides, it's worth the effort: there's many a topic for an evening of thinking in there.But that's not what you buy it for.Then there's the business of the Norse Gods walking the Earth, just like your average John Smith. Sort of. Thor naturally makes more of a nuisance of himself, but anyway, the notion of everything that the human race ever chose to believe in being true, and staying true long after we've ceased to need it to be true as well, is an astonishingly moving one. &quot;Immortals was what you wanted, and immortals was what you got&quot;, complains one of them bitterly. And rightly so. What would you do if you were an immortal, omnipotent being whom no-one believes in anymore? Chances are, you'd sell your immortal soul to appear in a soft-drink commercial. Once you accept the fantasy part of it, it all snaps in place with logical precision, and even going to Asgard becomes an accepted way to spend the evening.But that's also not what you buy it for.The most outstandingly entertaining thing about the book is, of course, the humour, which is more like what you buy it for. Douglas Adams is an expert for making a pun in a couple of words and leave you laughing longer, and louder, than many other humourists could in an entire page. The incredible lightness of it all is only apparent if you ever tried to write humourous stuff yourself, and thus know how hard that is. No wonder that there are so precious few books from this author. And no wonder that many try to emulate him, and fail.Still, this isn't entirely comedy, and that's a good thing, too. Yes, the Hitch Hiker books give a couple of insights into Life, the Universe and Everything as well -- but the Gently books give more of it, and more practically applicable examples of it, even to those of you who know where their towels are.One of my favourite examples is the way that one of the (mortal) key characters, Kate Schechter, explains how her name is spelled: &quot;Two E's, two C's, two H's, and also a T, an R and an S. Provided they're all there, the bank won't be fuzzy about the order they come in -- they never seem to know themselves.&quot; Okay, it's funny, but there's more to it than that: it's the kind of humour you can only really understand with a name like hers -- or mine --, which makes me wonder how someone with an instantly spellable name like Douglas Adams, of all people, found out about it.All in all, this is everything you could want: Hugely entertaining, but in an intelligent way, and not boring however many times you take to it.

This book explores a wide array of ideas, and focuses on communication, to find out what a woman really likes.I have read some of the reviews and have found a few negative ones written by men. But if the point of the book is to make a woman come, and the techniques listed in the book work (Do they ever, I'm STILL smiling) and focus on bringing the couple closer together, then how could a negative review be possible? Well, I suppose if a man is only focused on his own pleasure and is of a &quot;get on, get in, get off and get out&quot; mentality, then the book would not be of much use.But as for you fine gentlemen out there who seek to please your partner and fine tune your techniques, I highly recommend this book.

The Secret Childhood [First Printing],"2019 Reprint of 1936 First Edition. Full facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition software. Few people have had as dramatic an influence on modern ideas of child education as Maria Montessori. Born in 1870, Montessori was an Italian physician and educator. Maria drew on her own experiences working with children as well as insights from her Roman Catholic faith to pioneer a new way to help children learn. Her approach, known as the Montessori Method, continues to be used with great success today. In the preface to Maria Montessori's treatise on childhood learning The Secret of Childhood, Maria's son Mario clearly articulates the vision that his mother shared. In the first words of this preface, he writes: ""Today's problems with regard to youth and childhood are the most patent proof that teaching is not the most important part of education. Yet the delusion persists that teachers form the person through their teaching of the child."" At the center of the Montessori way is an understanding of the child as a person worthy of respect. She writes, ""I have come to appreciate the fact that children have a deep sense of personal dignity. Adults, as a rule, have no concept of how easily they are wounded and oppressed.""",['Maria Montessori'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZwbiyAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=ZwbiyAEACAAJ&dq=The+Secret+Childhood+%5BFirst+Printing%5D&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,2019-08-24,http://books.google.com/books?id=ZwbiyAEACAAJ&dq=The+Secret+Childhood+%5BFirst+Printing%5D&hl=&source=gbs_api,,,B000QKUVIK,,A2XYETY7I6U3GN,Laughterking,98/101,4.0,1079222400,The Secrets of 'The Secret of Childhood',"Since 1936, when her seminal work 'The Secret of Childhood' was first published, Maria Montessori has been the leading figure in promoting a holistic education approach to children of all ages. Concepts as radical as the three fundamental freedoms (the freedom to repeat work, the freedom to move around the classroom and the freedom to choose which work they want to do) that each child should have, blast forth form the pages like a breaking news story.However, the 'secrets' in the book quickly surface as Montessori begins with a look at the traditional perception of the child. She believed that the child was going to be the major concern of the twentieth century and when the education systems that exist today are compared to those of the turn of the 20th century, it can easily be argued that she was right.She does not end with feeble predictions, however, and goes on to talk of how adults have failed children and will continue to do so unless they change their attitude to children. For some this book will not turn out to be the rainbows and cuddly toys that they traditionally associate with books concerning young children! She pulls no punches in condemning those who have held children in such low regard for so long.The psychological features present in the new born child, feature strongly in the early part of the book. Montessori cites the work of Hugo de Vries as a precursor to her work on 'Sensitive Periods', which are essentially, periods of time throughout the child's development where he is able to learn certain life skills. Once these periods are missed, it is unlikely that the child will be able to learn the skill, ever. These skills include speech, mobility and several others. From this snippet alone, it would seem that this work is very important to all parents, or people who are thinking about being parents.Next there is a look at 'Order' and how important a well ordered environment is to the child. It is not as simple as putting everything away so that the child can not hurt him or herself with things or break things. Montessori believes that the child should be encouraged to explore the environment. She believes that the only real way that the child can do this, is if the environment is maintained so that the child can become familiar with its contents. The environment, she is careful to add, is not solely made up of the physical rooms and items, it is also made up of actions, sounds and everything that a child is exposed to.The second part of the book focuses on how to educate the child. As with much that Montessori writes, there is a certain spirituality contained in the book that seems to help adults in their comprehension of the fact that the child is to be perceived as a whole being. Throughout the section that tells a brief history of the first school, there is clearly a more metaphyical nature to this approach of education.The first school was opened in 1907, called Casa dei Bambini. The observations that Montessori took here are the basis for the Method she is famous for and also the overall essence of this book. Montessori, unlike most other educators, designed her classrooms to be 'hands-on' learning environments. She fashioned the equipment based on the work of 19th century education innovators, Jean-Marc Gaspard Itard and Edouard S&eacute;guin, with an emphasis on 'Sensorial' education and what she called 'Practical Life' exercises. (These exercises consisted of everyday tasks such as washing hands and buttoning coats, which she determined, led the children to higher independence). The materials were very didactic and allowed her to focus on the theory that she had of the child needing work for the hands.In the next section, she discusses the observations that she was able to make from the children in this setting. As mentioned earlier, she determined that there were three essential freedoms that the child needed to have in order to be successful. These freedoms are interspersed with observations about various other psychological behaviors that the children displayed. Their propensity for 'order' astounded Montessori and soon she allowed them to put the materials away, instead of having the teacher of the classroom do it. This, seemingly, small incident and many more like it, are the makings of Montessori. Her focus on detail is what allowed her to see beyond what other adults had either failed to see or had chosen to ignore.She continues with interesting information concerning the child's lack of attraction to toys that were placed in the room, due to their focus on the didactic materials that were present instead. She also discusses traditional rewards and punishment systems and how children are typically turned off and unaffected in the way that the system is designed to work. She writes instead, about 'Spontaneous Discipline' which she infers is directly related to the sense of order and the work for the hands.She continues the controversial (in some circles) theme of the book that introduces the role of the child as that of 'worker'. She exponentially speaks of the instincts that the child shows for work and follows this with the differences between the adult's work and the work of the child. Throughout the whole book, the focus that Montessori puts on elevating the child to a higher plane than that of the adult, is constantly noticeable.Her theories of inner growth through work are tied together in the last section also and we see the anthropological expertise that Montessori has brought to this study. She shows the steps that each of us go through to become an adult.In recognizing the wisdom of this great observer of people, this book goes a long way to helping the argument that the child-focused approach is the finest way to create great adults from children.",1

A Distant Mirror the Calamitous 14th Century,"A “marvelous history”* of medieval Europe, from the bubonic plague and the Papal Schism to the Hundred Years’ War, by the Pulitzer Prize–winning author of The Guns of August *Lawrence Wright, author of The End of October, in The Wall Street Journal The fourteenth century reflects two contradictory images: on the one hand, a glittering age of crusades, cathedrals, and chivalry; on the other, a world plunged into chaos and spiritual agony. In this revelatory work, Barbara W. Tuchman examines not only the great rhythms of history but the grain and texture of domestic life: what childhood was like; what marriage meant; how money, taxes, and war dominated the lives of serf, noble, and clergy alike. Granting her subjects their loyalties, treacheries, and guilty passions, Tuchman re-creates the lives of proud cardinals, university scholars, grocers and clerks, saints and mystics, lawyers and mercenaries, and, dominating all, the knight—in all his valor and “furious follies,” a “terrible worm in an iron cocoon.” Praise for A Distant Mirror “Beautifully written, careful and thorough in its scholarship . . . What Ms. Tuchman does superbly is to tell how it was. . . . No one has ever done this better.”—The New York Review of Books “A beautiful, extraordinary book . . . Tuchman at the top of her powers . . .

Goethe worked on Faust for much of his career, but composed some of the best of Part II in a time of life when most are in their rocking chairs or in the intensive care ward of the local nursing home. Goethe in his late seventies and early eighties would rise in the early dawn and compose some of the best poetry written. ""I would elevate my mind to a kind of productivity which brought all this forth, in a full state of consciousness and which pleases me still, even though perhaps I could never swim again in such a river."" It has been said that German poetry is difficult to translate or untranslatable, and this seems true with some translations of Faust, but the Norton contains a superb effort by Walter Arndt which appears always so on the mark that one suspects Arndt actually embellishes the German, but, rather than quibble over accuracy, it is all so good you will hardly care. Goethe builds upon the medieval Faust legend as a skeleton for his own writing in epic-poem style with various meter fashioned to fit the subject. Faust, weary of the ways of the world (one can almost hear the 60s hippy) embarks on a journey of self-discovery, skirt chasing and empire building finally ending in his 100th year in the ultimate trip, with a little help from his friend, Goethe. This composition is remarkable in innumerable ways. One can use a thesaurus of superlatives: wonderful imagery, perfect choice of words, peerless imagination, beautiful poetry, a unity to the whole which is memorable, as well as numerous wonderful scenes and lines, and always an intelligence that seems to absorb and understand everything. Of course, one can differ with Goethe philosophically. There are other angles from which to view life than Faust and his Mephistophelean foil. And Faust, which contains all the universal ingredients, can be faulted at times, dwelling too much on the antique philosophy, politics and literary questions which interested Goethe in his long life. But all this seems irrelevant to Faust as a work of art, permanently canonized for its beauty and writing alone, whatever disparagement or praise one might hold for its meaning or content. The Norton Edition is edited by Cyrus Hamlin whose interpretive notes are scholarly, contain a subtle respect for Goethe, and are in themselves a book worth reading. The selections of Goethe comment and scholarship range from the brilliant to the outer eliptics of literary criticism, and the included illustrations and Goethe letters on composition are a nice touch. The work of Hamlin and the Arndt translation which here frame Goethe as the main event make the Norton Critical Edition of Faust (2000) one of the better books one is likely to pick up.",1

But in a way, they're the better ones. Especially this one.I won't bother telling the story, because frankly I cannot. Now, I've been reading this book in about monthly intervals for years, but I still find something new each time, and I still have trouble keeping track of the story. Don't let that keep you, though. Yes, it *is* mildly confusing, but it all works out after a couple of times of reading, and it's great fun from first time, page one. Besides, it's worth the effort: there's many a topic for an evening of thinking in there.But that's not what you buy it for.Then there's the business of the Norse Gods walking the Earth, just like your average John Smith. Sort of. Thor naturally makes more of a nuisance of himself, but anyway, the notion of everything that the human race ever chose to believe in being true, and staying true long after we've ceased to need it to be true as well, is an astonishingly moving one. &quot;Immortals was what you wanted, and immortals was what you got&quot;, complains one of them bitterly. And rightly so. What would you do if you were an immortal, omnipotent being whom no-one believes in anymore? Chances are, you'd sell your immortal soul to appear in a soft-drink commercial. Once you accept the fantasy part of it, it all snaps in place with logical precision, and even going to Asgard becomes an accepted way to spend the evening.But that's also not what you buy it for.The most outstandingly entertaining thing about the book is, of course, the humour, which is more like what you buy it for. Douglas Adams is an expert for making a pun in a couple of words and leave you laughing longer, and louder, than many other humourists could in an entire page. The incredible lightness of it all is only apparent if you ever tried to write humourous stuff yourself, and thus know how hard that is. No wonder that there are so precious few books from this author. And no wonder that many try to emulate him, and fail.Still, this isn't entirely comedy, and that's a good thing, too. Yes, the Hitch Hiker books give a couple of insights into Life, the Universe and Everything as well -- but the Gently books give more of it, and more practically applicable examples of it, even to those of you who know where their towels are.One of my favourite examples is the way that one of the (mortal) key characters, Kate Schechter, explains how her name is spelled: &quot;Two E's, two C's, two H's, and also a T, an R and an S. Provided they're all there, the bank won't be fuzzy about the order they come in -- they never seem to know themselves.&quot; Okay, it's funny, but there's more to it than that: it's the kind of humour you can only really understand with a name like hers -- or mine --, which makes me wonder how someone with an instantly spellable name like Douglas Adams, of all people, found out about it.All in all, this is everything you could want: Hugely entertaining, but in an intelligent way, and not boring however many times you take to it.

I cannot state enough how wonderful this book is in helping your child grow and develop above and beyond their current level, not just incrementally, but in leaps and bounds! I have a daughter with autism and first I tried the Behavioral books, such as &quot;Behavioral Intervention for Young Children with Autism&quot; along with all the other books based on the Lovaas Method and the Behavioral Model of teaching which is shaping behavior step-by-step using reinforcers (just how Pavlov got a dog to ring a bell for food or how, in my Psychology class, I got a pigeon to peck a red dot for food) I tried the Lovaas method for one year, also called ABA or Applied Behavioral Analysis, and my child did not progress in her development. She was also enrolled in an Early Start class and was getting speech therapy. Finally I bought Dr. Greenspan's book when my daughter turned 3, one year after her diagnosis. I only wish I found this book earlier! This is based on the Developmental approach to learning. It is full of hope, not false hope like dietary cures, but real hope based on real methods that are simple to learn, make a lot of sense and are based on how children actually learn. It really makes perfect sense when you read it: Play with your child, keep an interaction going, keep them actively engaged, block them from self-stimulating or hiding into their own world, keep them interacting with you. This is a lot of work, but it is natural and rewarding and you can do it yourself without training. You do not have to do this all day long. Dr. Greenspan recommends several 30-minute sessions of ""Floortime"" each day. Do not believe the bad reviews on this book that say something like, ""If your child flaps their arms, flap with them."" I kept away from this book for one year based on such reviews, but that is not how it is at all! This book is empowering and enlightening. Dr. Greenspan's entire premise is based on this: Although your child is disabled, they can learn and grow way beyond any level you could imagine for them or any teacher could vision for them, by having high expectations and not limiting them based on their label. Yes it is work, but with a little effort on your part, your child can really improve and learn self-help skills to become an independent adult. That is the goal for all children with special needs and it's not easy to get them there, but for most all children it is doable with work, time and attention and high expectations that it can and will happen! Dr. Greenspan does not throw out the Behavioral approach of Lovaas at all- he even states that for some children both approaches are necessary to learning, he has an entire chapter on this. Each child is unique and each child needs an approach tailored to what works best for that child. For my daughter, Greenspan's approach really works and after using this method for several months, she is now enrolled in an integrated Preschool with mostly typically developed children- Something she never could have achieved without the Greenspan approach!",1

As a student of the Russian Technical Regimen, a method directly derived from Leschetizky's teachings, I found the book to be an excellent supplement. Its 92 pages are crammed full of piano technique, including finger dexterity and independence, timing, use of the metronome, scales, chord playing, arpeggios, embellisments (such as grace notes), use of the pedal, performance tips, suggestions for memorizing, and a lot more, and has either exercises for or examples of each, with sketches of Leschetizky's hands on the keyboard demonstrating hand position for the chords and exercises.

The BMJ article cited by the anonymous reader [BMJ 223:1206, 24 Nov 2001] actually states: ""it was unlikely that overdoses had caused the deaths and illness"".

A more reasonable interpretation might be that the vitamin A supplement was saving lives.As Saul says, azithromycin is no better than low dose vitamin C for treating viral bronchitis. It is well known that antibiotics are generally ineffective against viruses. To treat an infection with vitamin C, pharmacological doses are required. A minimum pharmacological dose of vitamin C is 10 grams. Once again, Dr Saul's book was correct.On a similar note, the reader with no name's assertion, that doses of 10 grams are appropriate for the treatment of cancer, is also incorrect. Dr Saul suggests that doses of the order of 100 grams are appropriate, and this is accurate for orthomolecular therapy. A typical regime would be 20+ grams of oral vitamin C daily and intravenous infusions of 75 grams (sodium ascorbate) three times per week. The reported side effects are typically minor, but treatment of cancer really does require a qualified physician; Saul repeatedly asserts this.While some people declare they have all the answers for nutrition, and make inappropriate health claims, Dr Saul works from the facts. His book is a fantastic read and provides excellent guidance on supplements and health.Dr Steve Hickey",1
Sacred Path Cards: The Discovery of Self Through Native Teachings,"This extraordinary tool for self-discovery draws on the strength and beauty of Native American spiritual tradition. Developed by Native American medicine teacher Jamie Sams, this unique system distills the essential wisdom of the sacred teachings of many tribal traditions and shows users the way to transform their lives. The 44 beautifully illustrated cards, each endowed with a particular meaning and message, may be drawn individually for a daily lesson or laid out in a series of spreads that open up different paths to inner knowledge. Used with the accompanying text, which explains the various forms and methods of interpretation and divination, the cards are a powerful tool for enhanced self-awareness and positive change.",['Jamie Sams'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UAGEPwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=UAGEPwAACAAJ&dq=Sacred+Path+Cards:+The+Discovery+of+Self+Through+Native+Teachings&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,HarperOne,1990-10-12,http://books.google.com/books?id=UAGEPwAACAAJ&dq=Sacred+Path+Cards:+The+Discovery+of+Self+Through+Native+Teachings&hl=&source=gbs_api,"['Body, Mind & Spirit']",2.0,0062507621,23.76,A39EBF16TSE1A,gaiea,98/101,4.0,964569600,Not hocus pocus,"One of the reviewers spoke for Native Americans who might view these as hocus pocus.

All provides a message to us in teaching and that is indeed the Native way.I rather enjoy the cards, when I am centred and holding pure intent...I ask that I receive all messages meant for me. It can come through the cards or not, but always appears to those with hearts and ears willing to hear.If one is looking for another tool to connect, consider the cards, but with the frame of mind/heart that says these are not to give you THE answer, but an answer...a guide.

The Big Sky,"This Newbery Honor winning, New York Times bestseller celebrates the true spirit of independence on the American frontier. For most of her life, sixteen-year-old Hattie Brooks has been shuttled from one distant relative to another. Tired of being Hattie Here-and-There, she summons the courage to leave Iowa and move all by herself to Vida, Montana, to prove up on her late uncle’s homestead claim. Under the big sky, Hattie braves hard weather, hard times, a cantankerous cow, and her own hopeless hand at the cookstove. Her quest to make a home is championed by new neighbors Perilee Mueller, her German husband, and their children. For the first time in her life, Hattie feels part of a family, finding the strength to stand up against Traft Martin’s schemes to buy her out and against increasing pressure to be a “loyal” American at a time when anything—or anyone—German is suspect. Despite daily trials, Hattie continues to work her uncle’s claim until an unforeseen tragedy causes her to search her soul for the real meaning of home. This young pioneer's story is lovingly stitched together from Kirby Larson’s own family history and the sights, sounds, and scents of homesteading life.

This is unusual because it deals with a moment in time that isn't really dealt with that much - the Rocky Mountain fur trade during its golden age of about 1820 - 1850. The cowboy era has been responsible for most of western film and literature, partly because the images and events that happen in that world are recognizable to us: the economic and social issues you always see dealt with in ""cowboy"" movies mirror our own experiences in many ways. The cowboy has also been said to be an image of freedom to Americans, when actually nothing was further from the truth. Cowboys were regular working stiffs, about as romantic as carpenters or plumbers in their own day. They didn't consider themselves ""free"", nor would they have spent much time thinking about it during their brutal 14 hour work day. They did what they did because they loved horses and riding and cattle and it was good honest work that paid a living wage, and there was a bit of swagger to it - people in town recognized cow hands for the tough-as-leather men they were, especially with their characteristic boots and hats and general flair for the dramatic that many had. But it was backbreaking work, and the entire cowboy heydey lasted less than 30 years.I said all that to say that ""The Big Sky"" really is about freedom, and really is about the West. It's about the true, wild, primitive west, before the plow, before roads, when there were still huge, intact Indian cultures in place with armies of horsemen and enormous herds of buffalo. So it's interesting to me that this genre is largely ignored, but I can see why - there are no set-piece plots just begging to be turned into movies - no ""new sherriff in town"" characters, because there are no sherriffs, and no towns other than a few trading posts. There is only the land and the sky and the interaction between a few incredibly brave white men and all those Indians.If you don't already know, this is the story of Boone Caudill and his friend Jim Deakins, and several important side characters, but it's basically Boone's book. He's driven west by an aching need for wildness and freedom, and is pushed out by a brutal father. He makes his way west to St. Louis, along the way befriending Deakins, in hopes of meeting his uncle Zeb who had become a trapper years earlier. The rest of the tail is complex and interlaced, and not a simplistic good guy/bad guy plot at all, and what stands out is the crystalline depictions of the people and places and over all, arching like the sky itself, is freedom. Freedom to roam at will in that beautiful country is the main character of this book. Freedom is the religion, the politics, the philosophy, the recreation - it is everything that is important. The trappers are there to trap - sure - but they're really there because this is a wild, free place, where they will not be hampered by rules, where they can be natural men. It sounds over romanticized, but it really did happen that way, and from what we know, that is truly the way they felt about their lives and why they endured the agonies of that existence. Despairing that new settlers are moving west and building farms and towns, Boone cries ""Lord, Jim - remember the Tetons standing proud in the sun, and the Seeds Ke Dee...don't you remember her when she was all purty and new and not a man track on her save Injun?"" This novel makes you sob like few I've ever read. The sense of loss, the closing of an age of the world, hangs in the air like mist. They are going to be the last to see something so precious, and for their pains they get to watch their world wither and die under the press of settlement.The movie ""The Mountain Men"" with Charleton Heston comes close to capturing a tiny bit of this book, and you can tell it's inspired in many ways by it, but no other book or film has ever come close to truly painting the world of the mountain man as has this novel. ""Jeremiah Johnson"" is another good film, with many fine touches. But if you want to follow the water up stream, back to its source in the mountains, then please, before you grow too old, read ""The Big Sky"" and open your heart to that time and place and the wild, brazen beauty of the America few Americans know ever existed.",1

Bread Alone: Bold Fresh Loaves from Your Own Hands,"""Good bread is hard to find and easy to make,"" says Dan Leader as he draws you into the ancient world of traditional bread baking. Unlike any other bread book, Bread Alone will provide you with a comprehensive guide to creating—at home—the country-style breads that have consistently captured the imagination and the taste buds of the world. In a richly told tale, Leader chronicles his crossings of America and Europe to locate the most vital ingredients at the source, to learn from the methods of the world's great bakers, and to perfect their traditional techniques. His recipes are ones that have been used for centuries: large sourdough ryes, rich and dark raisin pumpernickel loaves, real French pain au levain, big round wheats with walnuts, crusty baguettes, high and airy breads, and more. Made from organic, stone-ground grains, these breads are slow-leavened, hand-shaped, and baked to perfection on heated baking tiles. As you read through the recipes, you can almost smell the ancient aroma of baking bread. And as you begin to bake, you will learn the importance of the primary ingredient in great bread: your own observations. These are some of the breads and techniques you will master: In the chapter ""Becoming Bread,"" you will learn to identify and shop for the highest quality flour available. And you will seek it out because you'll taste the difference. Making a poolish will become second nature to you as you master the Learning Recipe: Classic Country-Style Hearth Loaf and its delicious variations. Whatever your schedule, there is a bread for you. In the chapter ""Straight-Dough Breads: Traditional Breads for a Modern Life-Style,"" you are shown how to start and finish a recipe in five hours, or morning-to-night, or night-to-night. You will bake sourdough bread in its many forms. By gently introducing the concept of sourdough—how it is made, how it is maintained, and how to get the best flavor from it—Leader demystifies it and makes it accessible to you. Discover the wonders of rye bread: From the dense and chewy Finnish Sour Rye to the fragrant Danish Light Rye, everyone's tastes are served. The mystery of pain au levain, French for ""bread from a sourdough or wild yeast,"" unfolds into an understandable, user-friendly process. From My Personal Favorite Pain au Levain, a typical large Parisian loaf, to Pain au Levain with Pecans and Dried Cherries, the ""Family of Traditional Pain au Levain"" includes some of the best loaves baked around the world. A perfect baguette is a beautiful thing. From shaping to scoring, you will learn how to make the authentic French baguette at home. The purpose of an organic certifier—find out how and why one farmer becomes dedicated to his role as land steward. Brioche, Chocolate-Apricot Kugelhopf, Panettone, and Semolina Sesame Rolls are a few recipes you will find in ""A Family of Breads Inspired by Traditional French and Italian Breads."" Finally, when a quick bread is all you have time to bake, you will find recipes for such delights as Vanilla Bean Butter Loaf; Dried Pear, Port, and Poppy Seed Loaf; and Provolone Sage Corn Loaf. Bread Alone is the bread book that cooks and bakers have been waiting for. From the wheat fields of the Midwest to the hot and steamy boulangeries of Paris, you will travel the long and delicious road to flawless bread baking. You will emerge a better baker and with a deeper understanding of what it takes to make perfect loaves. Bakers entertain you with stories of their love of baking (even in the most adverse situations).

Not only does Mr. Leader show the home baker, through step by step process of making Artisan bread, he laces his recipes with personal stories of his trips to France, learning from the French Boulangers and their sometimes personal stories. Not only is the book well worth it's recipes, it makes for enjoyable reading. This book goes beyond the recipes found in Baking with Julia, a very good book.

They've tried the countless parenting books on the market, but many of these are strident, fear-based books that loving parents instinctively reject, while still searching for direction. Now Dr. Tim Kimmel, founder of Family Matters ministries, offers a refreshing new look at parenting. Rejecting rigid rules and checklists that don't work, Dr. Kimmel recommends a parenting style that mirrors God's love, reflects His forgiveness, and displaces fear as a motivator for behavior. As we embrace the grace God offers, we begin to give it-creating a solid foundation for growing morally strong and spiritually motivated children. Releasing in an affordable trade paper edition, this revolutionary book presents a whole new way to nurture a healthy family.",['Tim Kimmel'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Qscqm5jecXQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Qscqm5jecXQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Grace-Based+Parenting&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Thomas Nelson,2005-05-15,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Qscqm5jecXQC&source=gbs_api,['Family & Relationships'],22.0,0849918030,,A2439YSDQDG2MU,Jennifer Schrank,98/100,5.0,1104451200,Excellent book that I would highly recommend,"I just finished reading this book and I would highly recommend it. It is directed toward Christian parents but has principles that non-Christian parents can use. My favorite suggestion from his book,which he used in his own family, is the ""What's Your Beef?"" night.(pages 206-208) To promote respectful candidness in his family, this night allowed his children an opportunity to tell their parents anything that either of them had said or done to hurt them. ""The qualification was that they couldn't bring up positions we had taken because of our moral standards(which they might have disagreed with) or consequences that we might have had to bring their way because of things they had done wrong...The key rule for Darcy and me when they shared these things from their hearts was that we were not permitted to defend ourselves...I might have been able to justify my words and actions from my perspective of the facts, but it would have only done harm. The point was, we had hurt them somehow, regardless of the facts.""He also gives an overall matrix that is very useful (what your child's three driving inner needs are and the four basic things you need to do to maintain a grace based environment)and uses many examples from his own family and others.He also communicates grace for you as a parent, since we all fall short. This book gave me hope and a great start to create a grace based home without compromising moral standards I want to uphold. He does a great job of balancing the two since often we as parents go to either extreme of legalism or anything goes.",1
"The science of getting rich,","The Science of Getting Rich is a book written by Wallace D. Wattles. It explains how to overcome mental barriers, and how creation, rather than competition, is the hidden key to wealth attraction.",['W. D. Wattles'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zwBzEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=zwBzEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+science+of+getting+rich,&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",DigiCat,2022-05-28,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zwBzEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],,B00087V4DM,,,,98/100,5.0,1012435200,"Practical, Hands-on Assistance; and Many Original Ideas","This new release is a reprint of the original 1910 edition of Wallace Wattles' guide to financial success and personal growth. Make sure that you get the new 2002 Iceni Books edition, and not some of the other versions that are around, which have been made unusable by editing. Wattles' book is a true classic in the genre, and it has been mentioned along with such other classics like George Clason's ""The Richest Man In Babylon"" and Napoleon Hill's ""Think and Grow Rich."" It was always a surprise to me, that this book, in full original title ""The Science of Getting Rich or Financial Success Through Creative Thought,"" is less well-known than the titles mentioned above. While Clason's book, in the essence, is a tale about the workings of exponential growth, and Hill's book is little more than the repetition of the formula, ""whatever the mind of man can conceive and believe, it can achieve,"" in Wattles' book there is much more to be found.Wattles, like Hill, also emphasizes the importance of using one's power of thought, and one's willpower, as an indispensable ingredient on the way to get rich. But Wattles with his suggestions is way ahead of Hill, because he does not think exclusively along egoistical lines, as does Hill. Throughout the book he warns the reader of acquiring riches in a competitive way, and strongly advises to do any business in a creative way instead. He asserts that the reader should never compete for what is already there, but should instead create something of value, be it a product, or a service. This thought alone is a revelation. Wattles makes unmistakably clear that only in that way it is possible for everyone to get rich. Instead of keeping others down by competition, if you strive to get rich in a creative way, you inspire other people to do so as well, and open up a way for others to follow.Besides this thought, which is original in how to get rich, and self-help literature, Wattles has much other original, yet always practical, advice for his readers, like how to best get into the right business, how to direct thoughts and actions purposefully, how to convey the impression of personal growth, and much more. I am issuing here, however, some kind of a warning to you: Wattles grounds his science on the ideas of oriental philosophies, which state that there exists one original substance in the universe, where all things originate from. To back up that notion, he mentions that this idea was also held by many western philosophers, like Hegel, and Emerson, and requires the reader to accept the truth of this notion by faith. I cannot say that I am a believer in the one substance, and still, I have learned some of my most important lessons from Wattles. So do not be put off by that esoteric concept, but concentrate instead on the solid foundations of financial and personal success that Wattles hands over to you. I am convinced that Wattles in this book says all that you need for success.",1
A Room With a View,"Featuring an appendix of discussion questions, the Diversion Classics edition is ideal for use in book groups and classrooms. Lucy Honeychurch journeys from England to Italy on holiday hoping to broaden her world, but it’s not the beauty of Florence that she falls in love with. No, trapped in a hotel populated by nothing but fellow Britons, it’s hard for Lucy to experience Italy at all. To make matters worse, the room with the view she was promised isn’t available. Overhearing her dismay, a father and son duo offer to switch rooms with her. It is a generous gesture met with revulsion from Lucy’s suffocating chaperone, for to accept would put them in a compromising position and be a major social gaffe. Touched by the kindness of it and for the first time in her life questioning the barriers of her social standing, Lucy develops a fondness for the two uncouth gentlemen. In fact, George Emerson, younger of the two, might be the only spot of joy Lucy has in Florence. No sooner does Lucy find herself falling for George, who values her mind and spirit, when she is whisked away to Rome. There, she meets Cecil Vyse who, though domineering, pompous, and snide, matches her social standing and proposes. Lucy, thinking she is making the most practical choice, is ready to settle for Cecil. But when George moves closer to her and confesses his true feelings, Lucy must choose between her true desires and that which she was taught was best her entire life.

At the time, that was the first serious book on relational database theory I read. I thought the earlier edition was a great introduction to the topic. It was a tough ""college textbook"" read, but well worth it.I would no longer recommend the latest version as an introductory text. One gripe is Date's introduction of his own language ""Tutorial-D"" to explain and illustrate concepts. There is no one place in the book you can go to for a comprehensive description of Tutorial-D. Instead, snippets of it are peppered throughout the text. Another gripe: he can be long-winded and pedantic, and he uses phrases like ""mutatis mutandi."" I understand he is a man with a mission to be exacting and precise. But somehow, he seems to have overdone it in this edition.The latest edition has many new chapters on object-relational, temporal databases, logic databases, and decision support systems. These are very convenient overviews, as always, filtered through Date's unerring and zealous devotion to the underlying relational theory.I think if you already understand relational theory and you are a practitioner in the field, this is still a comprehensive ""must have book."" But if you are starting out, you will want a kinder-and-gentler introduction. The ""love-it-or-hate-it"" reviews seems to support this viewpoint.I rated it 4 stars because (1) it is a classic (2) it is comprehensive (3) it is a reference work that any serious practitioner will want and (4) it has extensive and well-annotated references at the end of each chapter.I withheld the 5th star for the gripes I mentioned above.",0
The New 8-Week Cholesterol Cure: The Ultimate Program for Preventing Heart Disease,"The groundbreaking cholesterol-lowering program . . . now even more effective! Robert Kowalski's personal story is legendary. By the age of forty-one, he had suffered a heart attack and had undergone two coronary bypass surgeries. A traditional dietary approach to lowering his cholesterol failed dismally, and faced with the unpleasant alternative of a lifetime on medication, he created a program that proved astonishingly effective for him -- and legions of others worldwide who used it. Today Kowalski has beaten heart disease, lives an unlimited and vigorous lifestyle, and uses no prescription drugs. Now, with new information about risk factors, exercise, and supplements, The New 8-Week Cholesterol Cure is even more powerful in fighting heart disease. It includes: The facts about homocysteine and the deadly cholesterol Lp(a) A diet that jump-starts cholesterol reduction The heart-healthy secrets of niacin, other B vitamins, and safe supplements The latest findings on exercise New cholesterol-testing methods New heart-healthy products ... and more!

It also tells you what not to do, either because it's bad for you or because some other advice you may have received is a wive's tale.In plain, friendly language, Kowalski tells us what causes problems with the heart and how to find out if you're in trouble by asking for certain tests. He explains what these tests mean and what is considered normal/risky/dangerous.And, of course, he tells us what to do. There is much more to it than eating low fat, Kowalski explains. He tells you what fats you should be eating and what fats not to. He gives other very specific recommendations on what to eat, supplements, and exercise. All of these recommendations are backed up with medical research studies or explanations of why it works. Kowalski gives encouraging statistics and benchmarks on how much people in the past have improved by following certain recommendations.In my recent flurry of reading up on heart disease, much of what Kowalski has to say is in line with the latest research. There are even a few tips that I hadn't read about before, like a cholesterol-blocking plant sterol and, for those who want beef, special breeds of cattle that produce very low fat beef that is still tender.Kowalski even makes short recommendations on mental factors that can be heart harmful.The one pitfall in this book (and the reason why I didn't give it five stars) is the diet recommendations for weight loss. In a rare departure from the rest of the book, I don't think Kowalski supports this chapter is very well by citing medical research or scientific fact. Kowalski recommends a low-carb diet (40 grams or less) and very low calories (850). Forty grams of carbs is about 1-1/2 pieces of bread, and most nutritionists say that eating under 1,200 calories a day puts your body in starvation mode, in which your body slows down metabolism because it thinks you got stranded in the middle of the desert. Carbs are necessary to give energy to your brain. Putting your body in starvation mode means that the body will try and get energy from your muscles, meaning that if you gain weight later you'll have a larger proportion of fat to muscle. While I don't think all low-carb diets are dangerous (carbs, in my opinion, do need to be judiciously controlled), 40 grams a day and 850 calories is a bit extreme. I wouldn't follow the recommendations in this chapter.However, I wouldn't let this prevent you from buying the book. The rest of &quot;The New 8-Week Cholesterol Cure&quot; is full of wonderful advice to keep the cholesterol monster away.",1

Sue Heaser herself is a skilled and versatile PC worker, and she's managed, in this book, to be as inclusive and informative as a single PC author ever will be. (I do continue to hope for a technique book that has one editor and many authors, one for each are of PC use.) There is simply no way to go into detail on the nature of the info in this book; there's too much of it.

All I saw were brothers who could bury the hatchets of ethnicity and forge a country of love and peace. Before I read the book I saw Mandela as a super human with no flaws at all. In the book he painted himself in true colours; accepting his flaws and proclaiming his successes. He is afterall human. I have always believed that life is worth nothing if one can not stand up for what one believes in. I have always advocated to the Marcus Garvey/ Malcolm X forms of freedom fighting. I always thought that peaceful protests were for the spineless. Why would I like Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr., watch while the enemy unleashes violence on my people?

But that's not the problem -- it's the fact that the drawings are so impressionistic (though pretty) and that the signs are different than the signs she already knows, which are based on American Sign Language (ASL). It's this latter fact that will make me return the cards; I don't care to teach her different signs than she alredy knows for the same words.

Webster's New World Rogets A-Z Thesaurus,"Provides synonyms, antonyms, and related and contrasting words and phrases for thousands of terms","['Charlton Laird', 'Michael Agnes']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tUAOAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=tUAOAQAAMAAJ&dq=Webster%27s+New+World+Rogets+A-Z+Thesaurus&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Macmillan General Reference,1999,http://books.google.com/books?id=tUAOAQAAMAAJ&dq=Webster%27s+New+World+Rogets+A-Z+Thesaurus&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Reference'],1.0,0028632818,,A1IP8K9ENNJE3E,Jennifer L. Metcalf,97/99,5.0,1064966400,Wonderfully easy to use!,"This thesaurus is divided into two main sections: Roget's style thematic index and a dictionary style alphabetized index.The thematic index is divided into six areas, covering less than 20 pages:Abstract ConceptsSpatial ConceptsPhysical and material ConceptsHuman IntellectHuman Personality and ActionsHuman Emotions and BeliefsFor researching ideas, this first part is invaluable.However, the vast majority of the time, I use the extraordinarily convenient dictionary style index, covering nearly 900 pages. It's easy - if you need a new word to cover the same tired old word you've been using, just look it up. For example, here's the entry for the common word, friend:Friend, n. 1. [a person with whom one has mutual attachment] - Syn. Companion, intimate, confidant, comrade, familiar, schoolmate, playmate, best friend, close friend, roommate, bedfellow, fellow, fast friend, bosom friend, boon companion, mate alter ego, other self, soul mate, crony*, buddy*, sidekick*, bosom buddy*, homeboy*, homegirl*. Ant. Foe, ENEMY, stranger.2. [An ally] Syn. Compatriot, confrere, colleague; see associate (in boldface)3. [A patron] -- Syn. Supporter, backer, advocate, sympathizer; see patron (in boldface) 1.Make friends with (in bold face) - Syn. Befriend, strike up a friendship with, buddy up to*; see associate (in boldface) 1.When a word is in bold face, it means that the word is included in the thesaurus and may have other suggestions for you. The number after the bold face tells where in the entry to look for suggestions. The noun form of the word friend has three numbers referring to different definitions. An asterisk after a word, according to the thesaurus, indicates ""archaic, colloquial, dialect, slang, or other unusual usage."" The N after the entry word refers to its part of speech; in this case, the word friend is a noun. Syn. refers to synonym, or a word that is similar in meaning. Ant. refers to antonym, or a word that is opposite in definition.The very back of the book has a small handful of pages called the Supplementary Word Lists, which include endings of words, such as -cide, --cracy, --iac, --mancy, and so forth and gives a list of words with that particular suffix. For example, for -iac, the listings includes words such as insomniac, kleptomaniac, and paranoiac, among many others.In short, this is an excellent reference for a beginner (my ten-year-old frequently uses this thesaurus) as well as a seasoned professional. The organization is superb and it is easy to read and to follow. It's nearly impossible not to find the word that you seek!",1

The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement,,,,,,,,,,0884270610,,A1P7KRPACVQWGW,"H. Arsham ""Dr. Professor Hossein Arsham""",97/99,4.0,945302400,Making Informed Decisions,"In its simplest form, The Goal is about making effective and informed decisions. The author, Eliyahu Goldratt, takes his readers on a very thorough, step-by-step discovery of the many fallacies and misconceptions invading much of the way today's society views and measures the production process. Gradratt conveys his message in novel form by relaying the struggles of a man, Alex Rogo, who is trying to figure out a way to not only save his career but also save his marriage.Goldratt's brilliance is displayed through his thoughtful description of the production process, the necessary changes to the process and his careful thought processes described in such a way so even a layman could understand. The author stimulates your thought processes and compels you to join Alex Rogo in his search for answers. At first glance, The Goal, seems to be an informative research about how to be successful. However, you quickly realize that you are caught up in the life of Alex Rogue, a plant manager, who does not even know if he will have a job in a few months and you become entranced in the story of his life and you want to continue reading. Alex makes some important discoveries in his journey through the production process that enhances and sharpens his critical thinking skills. These epiphanies are transformative not only to the Alex Rogo but also the reader.Realizing he had very little time left to make some very important changes, Alex Rogo remembered an old friend of his, named Jonah, which he had recently bumped into at an airport. They had chatted about the problems of the plant and Jonah asked him some very pointed questions that caused Alex to start thinking. Throughout the book Jonah never tells Alex what it is he needs to do, which would seem simple. Instead Jonah guides Alex in the right direction by using questions to keep him thinking along the right lines. Because Alex leads himself through his problems using logic and common sense his answers are simple, so simple he has a hard time finding them sometimes. For example, Alex had a very difficult time figuring out the link between dependent events and statistical fluctuations. However, after a thought provoking hiking trip with his son's Boy Scout troop he discovers some simple processes that he uses to help turn his plant in the right direction. Another interesting discovery he made involved identifying and treating the bottlenecks, secondly he found that he could do something about them. After discovering the bottlenecks and finding that the throughput of the bottlenecks was the throughput of the plant, Alex found ways to increase the capacity of the bottlenecks thereby increasing the bottom line. With some simple changes that went against all the standard universal manufacturing principles he was able to fill all of his late orders and start getting the products to the customers by the specified due date or perhaps a little earlier.Eliyahu Goldratt tactfully disseminates the common beliefs about today's production process. He demonstrates the side effects of these practices and illustrates the necessary changes in order for success. For example, when Alex and his staff realized that cutting the production lot size in half not only decreased inventory and increased throughput but also increased sales, they could promise shorter delivery times.One of the most amazing things about The Goal, which was aggravating at first, was that Goldratt never communicated the product that was being manufactured. This was a clever way of encouraging the reader to focus on the process and the decisions being made rather than the product itself. The author was communicating that these transformations can take place in any process by using informed decision making skills instead of relying on a current process. The previous decisions and processes that Alex Rogo was making were based on tradition not critical thinking. As he saw his job and the jobs of many others start to deteriorate he started thinking through the process very carefully and he found many errors and misconceptions in the current systematic approach. Alex proved to his company that common sense is certainly not to be ignored for the sake of tradition.Business students taking Operations Reseach/Management Science courses, will find The Goal to be very encompassing, bringing to light many unclear ideas about the production process as well as leaving them with enhanced critical thinking skills. The author conveyed, without expressly stating it, that it is important that you analyze why and how you are doing it and not to rely on the process to always be right. Most of the book I found myself contemplating the very issues in question, wondering if there really was an answer that would solve the problem or problems. And after a discovery would be made I would say to myself, of course! How could I have forgotten about... . Eliyahu Goldratt led me through the thoughts of Alex Rogo and I made the decision breakthroughs with Alex and became excited in the findings. I found this book to be a captivating reading assignment that sparked students interest and they many valuable lessons about managerial decision making.",1

At the time, that was the first serious book on relational database theory I read. I thought the earlier edition was a great introduction to the topic. It was a tough ""college textbook"" read, but well worth it.I would no longer recommend the latest version as an introductory text. One gripe is Date's introduction of his own language ""Tutorial-D"" to explain and illustrate concepts. There is no one place in the book you can go to for a comprehensive description of Tutorial-D. Instead, snippets of it are peppered throughout the text. Another gripe: he can be long-winded and pedantic, and he uses phrases like ""mutatis mutandi."" I understand he is a man with a mission to be exacting and precise. But somehow, he seems to have overdone it in this edition.The latest edition has many new chapters on object-relational, temporal databases, logic databases, and decision support systems. These are very convenient overviews, as always, filtered through Date's unerring and zealous devotion to the underlying relational theory.I think if you already understand relational theory and you are a practitioner in the field, this is still a comprehensive ""must have book."" But if you are starting out, you will want a kinder-and-gentler introduction. The ""love-it-or-hate-it"" reviews seems to support this viewpoint.I rated it 4 stars because (1) it is a classic (2) it is comprehensive (3) it is a reference work that any serious practitioner will want and (4) it has extensive and well-annotated references at the end of each chapter.I withheld the 5th star for the gripes I mentioned above.",0

DANCE TO THE PIPER,"Born into a family of successful playwrights and producers, Agnes de Mille was determined to be an actress. Then one day she witnessed the Russian ballet dancer Anna Pavlova, and her life was altered forever. Hypnotized by Pavlova’s beauty, in that moment de Mille dedicated herself to dance. Her memoir records with lighthearted humor and wisdom not only the difficulties she faced—the resistance of her parents, the sacrifices of her training—but also the frontier atmosphere of early Hollywood and New York and London during the Depression. “This is the story of an American dancer,” writes de Mille, “a spoiled egocentric wealthy girl, who learned with difficulty to become a worker, to set and meet standards, to brace a Victorian sensibility to contemporary roughhousing, and who, with happy good fortune, participated by the side of great colleagues in a renaissance of the most ancient and magical of all the arts.”",['Agnes de Mille'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=p2zXCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=p2zXCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=DANCE+TO+THE+PIPER&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,New York Review of Books,2015-11-24,http://books.google.com/books?id=p2zXCwAAQBAJ&dq=DANCE+TO+THE+PIPER&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],,B000IZX50Y,,A1MK73GW682ZI,Anne Cahill,97/99,4.0,960768000,A fine romance,"This was the first of the O'Hurley series that I read, because it is almost impossible to tell which one goes first!

That said, this book was very enjoyable. Maddy, the &quot;youngest&quot; of the O'Hurley Triplets, is a dancer by profession and by nature. She has grown up in the theater and knows nothing about hiding her emotions or her feelings -- they are meant to be acted upon! When she meets Reed Valentine and almost immediately falls in love with him, she must learn how to deal with someone who is less forthcoming than herself, and who may never be able to love her the way she does him.Well, this is a Nora Roberts romance, so we know she'll eventually succeed, but the book was very entertaining and enjoyable in getting to that point.

A Path With Heart - A Guide Through The Perils And Promises Of Spiritual Life,"“This important guidebook shows in detail and with great humor and insight the way to practice the Buddha’s universal teachings here in the West. Jack Kornfield is a wonderful storyteller and a great teacher.”—Thich Nhat Hanh “Jack is helping to pave the path for American Buddhism, bringing essential basics into our crazy modern lives. And the language he uses is as simple and as lovely as our breath.”—Natalie Goldberg Perhaps the most important book yet written on meditation, the process of inner transformation, and the integration of spiritual practice into our American way of life, A Path with Heart brings alive one by one the challenges of spiritual living in the modern world. Written by a teacher, psychologist, and meditation master of international renown, this warm, inspiring, and expert book touches on a wide range of essential issues including many rarely addressed in spiritual books. From compassion, addiction, and psychological and emotional healing, to dealing with problems involving relationships and sexuality, to the creation of a Zen-like simplicity and balance in all facets of life, it speaks to the concerns of many modern spiritual seekers, both those beginning on the path and those with years of experience. A Path with Heart is filled with practical techniques, guided meditations, stories, koans, and other gems of wisdom that can help ease your journey through the world. The author’s own profound—and sometimes humorous—experiences and gentle assistance will skillfully guide you through the obstacles and trials of spiritual and contemporary life to bring a clarity of perception and a sense of the sacred into your everyday experience. Reading this book will touch your heart and remind you of the promises inherent in meditation and in a life of the spirit: the blossoming of inner peace, wholeness, and understanding, and the achievement of a happiness that is not dependent on external conditions. Sure to be a classic, A Path with Heart shows us how we can bring our spirituality to flower every day of our lives.

It contains both useful practical advice on living a spiritual life and amazing esoteric descriptions of super-normal states. Numerous pages contain &quot;gems&quot; that speak directly to my personal struggles and experiences. And Kornfield has a great sense of humor with deep compassion.One of the things that attracts me to Buddhism is its relative lack of superstition and dogmatism. The essential teaching is practical, down-to-earth, and perfectly acceptable to a scientifically minded person. Still, many Buddhists believe in reincarnation, and Kornfield describes some pretty far out experiences involving, for example, reincarnation, angelic beings, and psychic powers.Kornfield is a wonderful writer, and I hear that he is such a good teacher that one has to enter a lottery to get the chance to go to one of his retreats. He seems to be a charismatic, highly advanced being (though, who am I to judge?). But he would be the first to warn against starry-eyed adulation of him. An oft-repeated theme throughout the book -- and the topic of one whole chapter -- was the need to beware of unhealthy, exploitative relationships with teachers. Every spiritual seeker has one or more fallings-out with a teacher, he says. These fallings-out can be painful and damaging, but we must learn to learn from such events.Many people get the impression that Buddhism is an austere, impersonal, ascetic religion, with little of the bhakti (devotion) found in many Christian and Hindu faiths. This book challenges that perception. Indeed, it's amazing how loving Buddhists can be, considering that they tend not to believe in God! One thing that impresses me is his apparently complete lack of cynicism and pessimism. Kornfield has only good things to say about every major religion.In fact, another theme of the book is that Buddhism too should not be treated as a dogmatic teaching that we should grasp on to. Rather, it is a tool to be used to get where we want to go. Teachings and paths should be left behind when no longer needed, like a boat used to cross a river. (I'm reminded of Kornfield's story about a retreat in which two of his students, a married couple, were struggling hard to relax into meditation. Kornfield advised them to stop being so serious and to make love. They started to show up in the meditation hall smiling.)I'm still not completely convinced that a spiritual seeker can get by without faith and trust in some sort of divine being or essence. But this books goes a long way to showing how an atheist can have faith and hope.If you're on a spiritual path, or even if you're just curious and open-minded, read this book.

I especially like their bread machine recipes--always tastey. My favorite so far is ""Henk's Flax Bread"" which tasted like whole wheat bread. I can't recommend this book enough for beginners. And besides the bread recipes, there are loads of recipes for all kinds of meals you can make for the entire family.",1

"Italy With Kids, Second Edition","On Holiday In Italy Cool Kids Speak Italian has been written for children aged 7 - 11 by a qualified and experienced Foreign Languages teacher.

We read, and carried along, a few of the best guidebooks recommended, but Italy with Kids is the one that was the most helpful. Without repeating the well-deserved praise heaped on this book by a previous reviewer, I want to add some comments from our own experience:First, the book reveals information about many places and activities that we would never have found on our own. For example, instead of carting the kids through Milan, we chose instead to visit Vinci based on the authors' discussion of this tiny town nestled in Tuscany where da Vinci was raised. Our visit to the Museo de Leonardino in Vinci which is housed in an old castle, was enchanting to the kids who could come up very close to many of da Vinci's inventions and notes. The museum was small, extremely child-friendly, and best of all - uncrowded (and for Italy in June that is rare indeed).There are numerous other examples like this, and the section on Tuscany where we were based for much of our trip is outstanding. What other book mentions Snoopy's, a terrific gelateria in Cortona? Our 7-year-old had the important task of &quot;rating&quot; the gelatos we tasted in Italy, and found this one among his favorites. The book mentions the best gelato shops in many towns, a welcome treat after a day of sight-seeing and hiking up and down the steep streets. Unlike many other guidebooks, such small details as Pinky the cat who resides in the Fortress at Sirmione on Lake Garda were mentioned, and really drew the kids' attention. Of course, as soon as we arrived at the entrance, they asked where Pinky could be found and spent a good part of this visit entertaining the good-tempered feline, allowing us to spend some time enjoying the views and reflecting on the history of this intriguing fortress. In fact, I doubt whether we would have spent time at Garda at all if we hadn't read the book, heading instead for the more popular Lake Como on which most other guidebooks focus. Just as the Papes' noted, we were among the only American tourists in Sirmione, and we enjoyed several days with Italian, German and other European families. As for Hotel Sirmione, suggested by the authors, it went beyond our expectations. Ever swam in a 80+ degree mineral swimming pool, surrounded on three sides by a mountain lake? Other accommodation and restaurant recommendations were also excellent. What the book says is exactly what you will find, and its descriptions go well beyond what other guidebooks typically provide.In summary, this book is an outstanding resource for anyone traveling with kids...or who is a kid at heart. I am now waiting for books to be written on traveling with kids to other European countries. They will have a tough act to follow.",1

I have bought 5 Stevia books: David Richard's Stevia Rebaudiana, Jeffrey Goettemoeller's Stevia Sweet Recipes, James & Tanya Kirkland's Sugar-Free Cooking with Stevia, Rita DePuydt's Stevia, and Lisa Jobs Sensational Stevia Desserts. The Stevia information in all of the books is very helpful; however, Goettemoeller's book is the best for ""from-scratch"" bakers like me (I mill my own flour), but Lisa Jobs' recipes are great for ""casual"" bakers. The ingredients are easily found in my grocery store, the recipes are easy to follow, but the best recommendation is that every recipe I've tried in this book has been delicious, including the non-fruit ones. Stevia has no problem sweetening recipes with fruit in them--even my sugar-loving husband can't tell the difference--but Stevia can be bitter if too much is used. Lisa Jobs, however, has come up with the right amount of Stevia to make a recipe yummy. I've successfully made and enjoyed her cobblers, pumpkin bars and pumpkin custard (taste and texture like pumpkin pie!), cookies, Rice Custard Pudding, and just today, her Chocolate-Peanut Butter Fudge II. After tasting that, I knew I had to recommend this wonderful Senstational Stevia Desserts cookbook to others on ""no sugar added"" diets. The nutritional information for each recipe is an added plus. I'm doing my Christmas baking now for teacher, neighbor, and friend gifts, and those (diabetics, dieters, and/or limiting sweets) who receive the goodies from this cookbook will not feel deprived!Not only do you need a good Stevia recipe book, but you also need the right Stevia brand. I'd read that KAL was the best tasting brand, but KAL wasn't sold locally, so I had only used NOW powder or Sweet Leaf packets, which can make home-made desserts bitter, except in beverages, or if not combined with fruit or if not used in precise measurements. When my local NOW source couldn't deliver for 2 months, I checked on-line for a quicker source and discovered KAL brand available and decided to try it. I am so glad I did. The taste is never bitter. As an experienced Stevia user, I highly recommend KAL as the best tasting stevia available. If you're not liking the taste of Stevia, before giving up entirely on it, try KAL Stevia.And if you find stevia bitter, it's probably because you're still using sugar or artificial sweeteners also. My daughter-in-law discovered her normally delicious stevia-sweetened morning coffee would taste bitter if she'd had a non-stevia sweetened dessert the night before.",1

Originally I found few of his books ine one small Chinese store, and decided to give them a shot. I was thrilled when even my very first attempt resulted in noticing the difference. While the books were wonderful I did wish to have personal instruction, too. Lucky for me, about few weeks after I purchased the books, Mantak Chia was teaching a workshop in Toronto. Even though thsee initial practices are rather simple, it helped attending a workshop, too. I have attended all the workshops he came to teach in Toronto at the time. In the meantime, videos came out, so in time I got those too.You may or may not want to attend a workshop, but if for any reason you don't feel comfortable proceeding on your own, you may consider getting Mantak Chias videos. I like them very much (I have just about all of them) Another excellent resource is the book Qigong Empowerment.The focus of this book, Awaken Healing Energy Through Tao, is learing to circulate the energy through Microcosic Orbit. It is the essential practice for all future practices in Taoist Alchemy. The book also gives an overview of practices you can do if you wish to continue with your studies and practice.It is not hard to do. It is really simple. If you are new to this, the more complex part than the practice may be the use of different names in chinese for different points and a lot of theoretical information behind the practice.The practice essentially involves guiding the energy with your imagination - generating it, circulating it and storing it in your body.You can experience many benefits of this practice from the very beginning. What I experienced from the very beginning is a sense of calm. If I were ever upset and then begin doing microcosmic orbit, the upset would immediately disperse and dissolve. Doing microcosmic orbit practice had a centering effect. The practice is very, very simple but the benefits are far greater than may be initially apparent.As you keep on storing the energy, whenever any part of your body (organs) need more energy, they can use the energy you have stored instead of depleting the energy from other parts of your body. This in itself contributes to health. However, if you choose to continue your learning, there are many more advanced practices designed specifically for healing.",1
In the Buddha's Words: An Anthology of Discourses from the Pali Canon (Teachings of the Buddha),"The works of the Buddha can feel vast, and it is sometimes difficult for even longtime students to know where to look, especially since the Buddha never explicitly defined the framework behind his teachings.

For easy reference, the book is arrayed in ten thematic sections ranging from ""The Human Condition"" to ""Mastering the Mind"" to ""The Planes of Realization."" Each section comes with introductions, notes, and essays to help beginners and experts alike draw greater meaning from the Buddha's words.

The Reader,"Hailed for its coiled eroticism and the moral claims it makes upon the reader, this mesmerizing novel is a story of love and secrets, horror and compassion, unfolding against the haunted landscape of postwar Germany. When he falls ill on his way home from school, fifteen-year-old Michael Berg is rescued by Hanna, a woman twice his age. In time she becomes his lover—then she inexplicably disappears. When Michael next sees her, he is a young law student, and she is on trial for a hideous crime. As he watches her refuse to defend her innocence, Michael gradually realizes that Hanna may be guarding a secret she considers more shameful than murder.",['Bernhard Schlink'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2JYJicwT84cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=2JYJicwT84cC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Reader&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Vintage,2001-05-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2JYJicwT84cC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],222.0,0708940641,,A1OM1ORZYCZ8VY,"Friederike Knabe ""We write to taste life twi...",97/98,5.0,1103328000,A revised reading of relationships,"The topic of the Holocaust is raised almost every day in some manner. Many books have been written about the topic. Whether in studies, documentaries or fictional accounts, finger-pointing at the perpetrators of the crimes against millions has been part of the process of coming to terms with the Nazi atrocities. For Imre Kertesz, renowned author and Nobel laureate of 2002, there is no other topic. Yet, when he reflects on the traumatic impact of Auschwitz, ""he dwells on the vitality and creativity of those living today"" and ""thus, paradoxically, not on the past but the future."" Bernhard Schlink, professor of law and practicing judge in Germany, born in 1944, has attempted to capture the struggles of his generation in confronting the past and the future in ""The Reader"". ""Pointing at the guilty party did not free us from shame"", his narrator and protagonist contemplates, ""but at least it overcame the suffering we went through on account of it"".The usually unambiguous distinction between villain and victim has facilitated the identification with those who lost their lives or suffered under the Nazi atrocities while all scorn, abhorrence and hate was piled on the perpetrators. Until recently, few books have focused on the after-war generation. While growing up, the children had to come to terms with the, often sudden, exposure of their parents' active or passive participation in the crimes of the Nazi regime. ""The Reader"", set in post-war Germany and against the backdrop of the Frankfurt Auschwitz trials of the mid-sixties, takes this new and, for our generations, important angle: in the form of the fictional memoir of Michael Berg. Michael, while not refuting guilt, shame, and atonement, is led to examine and dissect the complexity of inter-generational conflicts in the context of his personal experiences. Like Schlink himself, he grapples with the fundamental problem of the relationships between these two generations.Michael recounts the most important stages in his life, starting with experiences long passed in his youth. While his account follows the chronology of events, he progressively interleaves retrospective reflections on his past conduct, questioning his conflicting emotions - his behaviour. The story starts with Michael's first, secret, love affair at age 15 with a woman more than twice his age. The blossoming erotic relationship strengthens his self-worth and confidence yet, at the same time, increasingly isolating him from his family and peers. Hanna Schmitz, of whose circumstances and background Michael knew very little, was affectionate and standoffish at the same time, prone to abrupt mood swings. The young lover is completely captivated and eager to please. He is the ""Reader"", in German ""Vorleser"" is a person who reads aloud to an audience. At her insistence he reads his books to her and it becomes an important element of their shared intimacy. When she disappears one day without any warning, her loss leaves him devastated and scarred for life. He can only seek the reasons in his own actions. Seeing Hanna again years later and in unanticipated surroundings, triggers a flood of questions about the person he loved and thought he knew. Her behaviour raises many questions and Michael discovers a long secret that puts in doubt the facts as they are exposed. He also wrestles with himself over his own inaction when confronted with choices. ""What would you have done?"" Although addressed to the judge by the defendant, this question hangs over Michael, as it does over his whole generation. It encapsulates the primary dilemma of the child-parent generations relationships. Finally, writing the story of his life, drafting and redrafting it in his head until it is in a publishable form, is seen as a chance for his own recovery and for living his own life.The Reader, while a work of fiction, is deeply anchored in the personal experiences of the author and symbolic for his generation. His spare and unemotional language underlines the impression of a biographical investigation and is used quite deliberately. The English translation captures the tone and style amazingly well. Reading this book should not be an ""easy pleasure"" as some reviewers have suggested. The Reader covers difficult and complex terrain in a way that it forces the reader to reflect and question their own position long afterwards. Although written directly for a German audience of Schlink's and my generation, the novel, surprisingly, has attracted world-wide attention. While reviews and reactions among readers are highly diverse and even contradictory, it should be read by as many people as possible and with the care the subject matter deserves.

I was highly excited to read this book as most books don't take your personality type into consideration.First off, you will probably get a lot more out of this book if you have already determined your Myers-Briggs personality type. The beginning of the book does try to help you determine your type, but it is mostly just picking one type over another when the actually score is really based on a continuum.After determining your time, the book has a chapter for each personality type. Since you only have one personality type, you only need to read one of the 16 chapters.The chapter written specifically for your type was just ok. The chapter was filled with examples of people who are that type. I just wanted to read about how my personality type applies to the job situation, not read example about my type. Eventually the chapter did get to what jobs would work best for you and things you should keep in mind when selecting a job. However, I was hopeing for a more in-depth explanation and analysis.While the book does an excellent job of focusing on your personality type, it does next to nothing to help you with determining your interests, passions and goals, all of which are vital to picking the correct job.So... if you know your Myers-Briggs type, which you should before you read this book, you only really need to read 10-15 pages out of this book. If you are really stuck on what job you are best suited for, pick this book up or just skim it in the bookstore. 3 out of 5 stars.",1

The Tale of Genji (Vintage Classics),"In the eleventh century Murasaki Shikibu, a lady in the Heian court of Japan, wrote the world's first novel. But The Tale of Genji is no mere artifact. It is, rather, a lively and astonishingly nuanced portrait of a refined society where every dalliance is an act of political consequence, a play of characters whose inner lives are as rich and changeable as those imagined by Proust. Chief of these is ""the shining Genji,"" the son of the emperor and a man whose passionate impulses create great turmoil in his world and very nearly destroy him. This edition, recognized as the finest version in English, contains a dozen chapters from early in the book, carefully chosen by the translator, Edward G. Seidensticker, with an introduction explaining the selection. It is illustrated throughout with woodcuts from a seventeenth-century edition.",['Murasaki Shikibu'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cZtoxEqGli0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=cZtoxEqGli0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Tale+of+Genji+(Vintage+Classics)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Vintage,1990,http://books.google.com/books?id=cZtoxEqGli0C&dq=The+Tale+of+Genji+(Vintage+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],3.0,0679729534,10.85,,,97/98,5.0,929318400,The necessity to adore and be adored.,"There is such a different tone to each of the translations. The sparse phrasing of Seidensticker's may be nearer to the original and from the point of view of following the plot it is certainly easier but Arthur Waley's translation is altogether more beautiful. In fact you become so mesmerized with the delicate description of the physical and the emotional that you fall prey to a kind of love affair with the book that Genji himself would have no difficulty understanding. The story is as much about each of the women as it is about Genji. Reviewers who have labelled Genji a playboy have completely missed the point; playboys are by definition carefree and non-suffering. In contrast it is the very fine nature of Genji's temperament and the intensity of his emotional attachments that lay him open to experience the most painful awarenesses. Moreover he is quite unable to banish past episodes from his consciousness or his conscience. Sexual attraction serves largely as a catalyst to romantic adoration rather than as a goal in its own right. If you study the range of language employed by Waley you will empower yourself with a vast arsenal of English phrasing. It is unlikely that any other book offers more from this point of view and I'm including here Proust, Joyce and the Bible. To the western reader it is an opening to a sensibility that many do not associate with Asia. To the Japanese student who has reached a high level of English a careful reading of Genji would be worth more than all the vocabulary books on the market. To both of them though, it would be a nourishing of their consciousness and although this undoubtedly leads to a multiplication of pleasure, it will also lead to a corresponding potential to contact with pain. Such is life and therefore I give to this work of art the greatest accolade, it captures something true, and beautiful. If you should find seidenstecker too matter of fact just try Arthur Waley, it is a matter of art.",1
The Wisdom of Insecurity: A Message for an Age of Anxiety,"Alan Watts is ""the perfect guide for a course correction in life, away from materialism and its empty promise"" (Deepak Chopra). Here he shows us how—in an age of unprecedented anxiety—we must embrace the present and live fully in the now in order to live a fulfilling life. Spending all our time trying to anticipate and plan for the future and to lamenting the past, we forget to embrace the here and now. We are so concerned with tomorrow that we forget to enjoy today. Drawing from Eastern philosophy and religion, Alan Watts shows that it is only by acknowledging what we do not—and cannot—know that we can learn anything truly worth knowing. “Perhaps the foremost interpreter of Eastern disciplines for the contemporary West, Watts had the rare gift of ‘writing beautifully the unwritable.’” —Los Angeles Times",['Alan Watts'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lg6HCFEvx-UC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=lg6HCFEvx-UC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Wisdom+of+Insecurity:+A+Message+for+an+Age+of+Anxiety&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Vintage,2011-11-16,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lg6HCFEvx-UC&source=gbs_api,['Self-Help'],15.0,B0006ASTGQ,,A2P8NMKSH0Q8A,"Jerry L.

This is one of them, and has turned out to be the one I refer to the most.First, let me say that there are two different types of books on drilling for oil/gas. Broadly, they are books that concentrate mainly on the financial and legal structure of oil deals and books that concentrate on where it is and how to get it out of the ground. This book is of the second sort.The ""nontechnical"" part of the title is only partly true. Some of the descriptions are sufficiently technical to impart a working understanding of the operations in the field. I, for instance, have been going to our rig (now drilling) and asking questions (""What's that blue thing?""), then coming home and reading about what I was told (""The jar is a section of pipe that either mechanically...."").Same with the drilling reports I receive.... I can look up that part of the drilling operation (ie, ""sliding"") and get a much better understanding of what's happening. A book comes in handy, after all, the tool pushers out on the rigs seem to be men of few words.There is also a pretty good basic course in petroleum geology in the first thirteen chapters. And, the science (art?) of geophysics gets a good once-over, too, though I confess I've not paid much attention to it yet.There are chapters on reservoirs, completion, offshore, production, workover, and more, all of which is written at the same level, and much of which I've not read in depth, only scanned. I'll read it as we get there out in the field.This is a sufficiently information-dense book that actually sitting and reading it from cover to cover won't realistically happen for most folks, no matter how involved. It's more of a textbook and reference resource.There are lots of diagrams and drawings and pictures (probably three hundred) and they help a lot. The lengthy glossary is OK, though I've not found a petroleum business glossary that seems to be truly comprehensive. (That was written before I found, and ordered, the comprehensive ""Dictionary of Petroleum Exploration, Drilling & Production"" by who else but Norman J. Hyne, Ph.D.,.... and nope, I have no axe to grind here; and yes, I have noticed that Norman seems to favor long titles). The folks in the oil business rely very heavily on their own language that is a combination of truly technical terminology, oilman slang and everything in between. A glossary is handy. Also be forewarned that the business uses lots of abbreviations, and they seem to change somewhat from company to company, so that a glossary won't ever have all of the abbreviations in use in the field.There are some other books that do a pretty good job on a more basic level, including ""Money In The Ground"" by John Orban, III (which also includes deal structure), but, if you are looking for a book that is deep enough to give you a good understanding of the many various aspects of drilling for oil, this is the book.",1

The Epic of Gilgamesh (Classics (Prebound)),"In Noorse goden combineert bestsellerauteur Neil Gaiman de oude verhalen uit de mythologie van de Vikingen met de stijl van de 21e eeuw. Voor de fans van Stephen Fry’s Mythos. In de New York Times-bestseller Noorse goden verwerkt Neil Gaiman, bekend van o.a. de prijswinnende novelle Coraline en de cult-serie American Gods, de losse Noorse mythen tot een doorlopend verhaal. Noorse goden begint met het ontstaan van de legendarische negen werelden en duikt dan in de levens van goden, dwergen en reuzen. Zo moet Thor zich vermommen als vrouw – lastig, met een baard en onstilbare honger – om zijn gestolen hamer terug te krijgen. Het bloed van Kvasir – de scherpzinnigste god van allen – wordt in honingwijn veranderd en geeft de drinkers ervan magische krachten. Het boek bereikt zijn piek aan het einde met het epische verhaal van Ragnarok: de ondergang van de goden en de geboorte van een nieuwe tijd en nieuwe mensen. Perfect voor de fans van Stephen Fry’s Mythos. ‘Een pakkende, spannende en eerlijk gezegd prachtige vertelling van deze beroemde verhalen.’ – The Washington Post ‘Uitzonderlijk.

The Epic of Gilgamesh (Penguin Audiobooks),"Andrew George's ""masterly new translation"" (The Times) of the world's first truly great work of literature A Penguin Classic Miraculously preserved on clay tablets dating back as much as four thousand years, the poem of Gilgamesh, king of Uruk, is the world’s oldest epic, predating Homer by many centuries. The story tells of Gilgamesh’s adventures with the wild man Enkidu, and of his arduous journey to the ends of the earth in quest of the Babylonian Noah and the secret of immortality. Alongside its themes of family, friendship and the duties of kings, the Epic of Gilgamesh is, above all, about mankind’s eternal struggle with the fear of death. The Babylonian version has been known for over a century, but linguists are still deciphering new fragments in Akkadian and Sumerian. Andrew George’s gripping translation brilliantly combines these into a fluent narrative and will long rank as the definitive English Gilgamesh. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus,"From the bestselling author of How the Irish Saved Civilization and The Gifts of the Jews, his most compelling historical narrative yet. How did an obscure rabbi from a backwater of the Roman Empire come to be the central figure in Western Civilization? Did his influence in fact change the world? These are the questions Thomas Cahill addresses in his subtle and engaging investigation into the life and times of Jesus. Cahill shows us Jesus from his birth to his execution through the eyes of those who knew him and in the context of his time—a time when the Jews were struggling to maintain their beliefs under overlords who imposed their worldview on their subjects. Here is Jesus the loving friend, itinerate preacher, and quiet revolutionary, whose words and actions inspired his followers to journey throughout the Roman world and speak the truth he instilled—in the face of the greatest defeat: Jesus' crucifixion as a common criminal. Daring, provocative, and stunningly original, Cahill's interpretation will both delight and surprise.

Cahill is obviously a learned man who examines Jesus from a ""scholarly"" viewpoint. He sees Jesus as only a man and certainly not God. In fact, he alludes that later Christians simply made up that Jesus was God. The problem with this approach is that, to analyze Jesus as only a man is to misunderstand Him. Jesus can only be analyzed as his total self-- God AND man, the God-man, God incarnate. Cahill's erroneous perspective leads him to many mistakes and ""veiled"" judgments regarding Christ.For example, in a section entitled ""Where is Jesus"", Cahill dismisses the traditional notion of resurrection-- i.e. that Christ rose literally from the dead and sits in heaven today-- calling this view ""too cerebral to make a lasting difference in the ordinary lives of ordinary people"". Instead Cahill insists on a more &quot;feel good&quot;, &quot;humanitarian&quot; approach to the resurrection. Christ, he says, is really resurrected in the poor and needy, ""incarnate in anyone and everyone who needs our help."" This is the true value of Jesus' life to Cahill.This ""social justice"" approach to Jesus, concludes Cahill, is a good one because in reality he says, ""nonsectarian, agnostic [scripture scholarship] has brought believers new riches."" (Christians will note that this idea is in direct conflict with 2 Corinthians 4:4). After all, he continues, the Gospels are really only a tale of a ""good human being"" and ""in the end, it has little to do with whether one believes Jesus to have been the Son of God [or not]."" His plea to Christians is to ""reassess Jesus"" since their sectarian, religious view of Jesus as the Lord and Savior has made Christians ""misunderstand Jesus in virtually every way that matters"".This book is radically misaligned with Christian beliefs. It purports itself to be a ""scholarly"" look at the ""historical"" Jesus, but misses the lasting message of Jesus as Savior and Lord. There are many other mistakes, claims that fly in the face of sound, church doctrine, and frankly at times plain buffoonery-- too much to include in this review. Indeed, this may even be a dangerous book for the Christian who is not well-versed in apologetics and doctrine because Cahill cleverly disguises his bent of denying Christ's divinity until the end-- which could seriously confuse Christians. If you wish to know more about Jesus a better alternative book would be ""The Case for Christ"" by Strobel. Check it out.",1

I followed up on a lot of the research, checked many of the sources myself, and Kate O'Beirne's meticulous assembly of evidence stood the challenge. What this boils down to is the conflict of facts with ideology. O'Beirne provides facts. Ideologues don't want to hear them.The difference between an authentic feminist and the people who claim to speak for the movement is that an authentic feminist sees the difference between equality of opportunity and equality of outcome. Women in the US have equality of opportunity. By ever-growing numbers, they choose to be mothers, they choose to embrace their femininity, and they recognize that they are born thinking and feeling differently than men. The women of NOW think that conditioning can overcome these differences, if they even acknowledge them. Authentic feminists realize that these differences are the glory of women. And they don't make women less intelligent or less capable than men.O'Beirne points out a body of evidence that proves beyond dispute that radical feminism has all but destroyed the family, and is ruining our children. She spends a chapter citing the damage done to boys in the classroom, and points out that by ever-greater numbers, young men aren't going on to college. This then creates a shortage of college-educated men for young women. This is a numerical, statistical FACT. Why then is it criminal to discuss it?Why is it verboten to point out that the children of single mothers are far more likely to end up in jail, use drugs, and fail academically? They are also more likely to be victims of child abuse and molestation. They are far more likely to be poor. These are also statistical facts. Why is it a betrayal of the sisterhood to seek to explain and fix the problem?Why, in a movement that supposedly promotes freedom of choice, is a stay-at-home mother assumed to be poorly educated, brainwashed, or a throwback to the 50's? Why is this choice not supported? If a woman chooses to put her career on hold to raise her children because she loves them, why is she insulted, smeared, and pilloried?Why is it the feminists oppose any and all war actions, when the War on Terror has liberated millions of severely oppressed women and given them unprecedented opportunity for education? An authentic feminist would be thrilled that these women are now voting and leading their communities.What's happening here even on Amazon is an attempt to simply shout down this book. The facts are indisputable, but that doesn't matter--it serves the cause. Rather than dealing with the issue, 'feminists' will ignore it. Rather than rallying to the cause of equality of opportunity, TRUE freedom of choice, and honestly improving the lot of women worldwide, those that call themselves feminists will shout insults, talking points, and twist O'Beirne's words out of any resemblance to what she actually said. Rather than focusing on raising strong, independent women AND men, they will continue to condemn ALL men, and this means YOUR sons, as the enemy, as a class of potential rapists. And men and women both will continue to suffer for it.Read the book, study the facts, and form your own opinion. An authentic feminist is a woman that doesn't need talking points or a chattering chorus to back her up. She actually looks at the evidence and thinks beyond her ideology. I've seen what feminism has made of the military. It's little more than a shelter for single mothers, and hunting grounds for irresponsible and honorless women who want a man. There are good female soldiers, but by and large, that's not who enlists. I've seen what feminism did to the men I went to school with not so long ago. O'Beirne is spot on in both her research and conclusions. Anyone with a shred of intellectual honesty would have first, read the book before reviewing it, and second, checked her research before dismissing the book as a whole.",1
Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed),"A literary sensation and runaway bestseller, this brilliant debut novel tells with seamless authenticity and exquisite lyricism the true confessions of one of Japan's most celebrated geisha. Nominated as one of America’s best-loved novels by PBS’s The Great American Read Speaking to us with the wisdom of age and in a voice at once haunting and startlingly immediate, Nitta Sayuri tells the story of her life as a geisha. It begins in a poor fishing village in 1929, when, as a nine-year-old girl with unusual blue-gray eyes, she is taken from her home and sold into slavery to a renowned geisha house. We witness her transformation as she learns the rigorous arts of the geisha: dance and music; wearing kimono, elaborate makeup, and hair; pouring sake to reveal just a touch of inner wrist; competing with a jealous rival for men's solicitude and the money that goes with it. In Memoirs of a Geisha, we enter a world where appearances are paramount; where a girl's virginity is auctioned to the highest bidder; where women are trained to beguile the most powerful men; and where love is scorned as illusion. It is a unique and triumphant work of fiction—at once romantic, erotic, suspenseful—and completely unforgettable.",['Arthur Golden'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SOM54qQ6BgkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=SOM54qQ6BgkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Memoirs+of+a+Geisha+(Signed)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Vintage,1999-11-09,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SOM54qQ6BgkC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],1631.0,B000HJNEYS,,A3V7ZYOJH83T34,TruthWillOut,97/139,1.0,1021507200,Orientalist Opportunism,"Arthur Golden is not a horrible writer and certain passages here are quite beautiful; the problem is that this book is not an act of literature but an act of opportunism. Writers must deal with and present either experiences or ideas or a combination of both. Ideas are in the public domain and one needs no qualification to traffic in them except for the ability to do so convincingly. This is not an issue here because Golden is not an &quot;intellectual&quot; writer and this is not a novel of ideas.Which brings us to the domain of &quot;experience.&quot; Now, I would never argue that authors must rigidly hew to the parameters of their own experience and turn out one autobiographical book after another. When writing a character-filled book in the third person, for example, an author is called upon to imagine other minds, other realities, other lives, and this exercise of the empathetic imagination can be a wonderous thing. The problem comes when an author, like Golden, attempts to write an entire novel in the first person from the vantage of a person who is completely removed from himself in time, space, culture, and gender. This does not spring from a desire for authenticity: it is, in fact, nothing more than literary machismo. &quot;Look!&quot; he's shouting, &quot;look what I can do!&quot; And it simply doesn't ring true, except to people who know even less about the subject than the author does.I am neither a geisha, nor Japanese, nor a woman, but I have lived in Japan longer than Golden has and I would wager my Japanese is just as good or better. Although Golden gets many of the factual details right, there is so much about the tone and the psychological sketching here that simply &quot;stinks of butter,&quot; as the Japanese used to say of Westerners a century ago. As a very serious student of Japanese literature, I can assure you that no Japanese would ever write like this, that is to say, like Dickens in a kimono. The novel is just too busy: too many characters, too much plotting, too much incident, and most damningly, too much naivete about the workings of the human heart. In fact, it should be made publicly known that the woman on whom Golden based this story sued him for misrepresentation and is in fact writing her OWN book to set things straight. She has her own pecuniary motivations, no doubt, but her criticism still stands. It's her life after all.It's good for Golden that so many people found this novel so ravishing and so interesting. He is a capable entertainer, and he knows the secret of entertainment: pander to your audience. Give them exoticism, but don't challenge their misconceptions. He spotted a market niche, he pulled off his high-wire act, and he's been amply rewarded. But if anybody thinks that this concoction attains the mighty beating heart of literature, let him or her think again.",1
The Rainbow Fish,,,,,,,,,,B0009GIFDY,,A2QZ2TKW5UQM3X,Maura W. Flynn,97/132,1.0,981331200,Ten reasons to avoid this book at all costs:,"This book has won several awards and is beautifully illustrated, thus I made the mistake of purchasing it for my daughter without reading it all the way through. Don't make the same mistake.This is the story of a beautiful fish who is hated and ostrasized by all the other fish in the sea because they envy his beautiful silver scales. I assumed that the moral of the story would have something to do with everyone being beautiful in his or her own way, and that eventually the other fish would come to recognize their own beauty. Unfortunately not. Instead, the Rainbow Fish is harangued and harrassed by his fellow fish until he has given away all but one of his silver scales. In the end he is very happy because he has become popular.The morals of this story are pretty shocking: 1.) It suggests that children should give in to peer pressure. 2.) It teaches children that friendship can be bought. 3.) It says that it is not only right, but a moral imperative, to sacrifice the very essence of yourself for the sake of popularity. 4.) It suggests that popularity is the ultimate good, and that one cannot be happy without it. 5.) It teaches that envy will be rewarded. 6.) It teaches children that it's okay to ostrasize people who are different. 7.) It teaches that rude behavior is acceptable if it gets you want you want. 8.) It suggests (to younger readers in particular, who may not be capable of grasping metaphor) that only outer beauty matters. 9.) It teaches that happiness can be achieved by tearing down or destroying what belongs to others. 10.) It preaches a kind of social Marxism: that there is no value in the uniqueness of an individual, that his worth and his happiness depend on his desire to conform to the values and demands of his peer group.Frankly, I am astounded that anyone saw fit to confer any honors upon this book.",0
Tactics of the Crescent Moon: Militant Muslim Combat Methods,"Tactics of the Crescent Moon shows for the first time in any detail how Muslim militants fight at short range. From the vast quantities of intelligence available, its author extracts the small-unit tactical trends. While the enemy's combat method may seem amateurish, they are nonetheless very effective in a 4th-generation-warfare environment. Those methods have already forced the Israeli Army out of Southern Lebanon and the Soviet Army out of Afghanistan. To make matters worse, they may be improving. In the book's forward, Maj. Gen. Ray L. Smith warns that the current crop of irregulars have flexible and adaptable training techniques and tactical methods. This book will help the reader to counter them.","['H.

Cranford,97/132,5.0,1118966400,Timely and time-sensitive; read to understand Iraq,"""Tactics of the Crescent Moon"" is timely because of the wars raging in the Middle East. These wars include and are not limited to Iraq and Afghanistan. The United States has been targeted by Middle Eastern terrorist since the late 1960's. As long as any of these exist, the United States will face Islamic warriors on jihad: the existance of corrupt governments in the Middle East, the existance of the state of Israel, failure to convert wholesale to the ""right flavor"" of Islam, providing a market for Middle Eastern oil, and lack of a global Islamic empire. The United States first fought Islamic warriors at the beginning of the 19th Century, when a handful of Marines, Sailors, and mercenaries fought and routed the Barbary Pirates. Following the Spanish-American War, Filippino Moros (Muslim tribes on Mindinao) proved so fierce that the .38 caliber Colt revolver was replaced by the .45 caliber Colt automatic pistol. Thus, the Muslim irregular is an old enemy for the United States. Surviving this foe requires a comprehensive and multi-pronged strategy. Basic to a viable startegy is understanding who the enemy is, why he fights, and lastly, how. Poole concentrates on the tactical defeat of the Islamic militant.American military units are poor at the short-range fight. Hand-to-hand combat has been neglected for reasons ranging from ""why waste efforts on something of marginal effectiveness"" to creating a female-friendly military environment. These lame excuses favored two groups--military careerists, and the enemy. Close combat training is difficult and dangerous. A zero-defect mentality coupled with the desire to empower women--without giving women the tools that empower--is being overtaken by current events. Units going to Iraq or Afghanistan are getting crash courses in city fighting, room-to-room combat, firing from moving vehicles, and reacting to ambush. Combat units are learning to detect and defuse ambushes before they occur. The US bases in the Middle East are hard targets, with defense in depth. Poole alludes to the timidity about sustaining casualties--it does hamper operations. Also hampering operations is the fear of inflicting collateral damage. Poole points out that skilled infantry can defeat the enemy with a minimum of casualties. This has been happening in Iraq, and the new Iraqi forces are taking over the burden of fighting the Iraqi insurgency. Unlike South Vietnam in 1968, there are not neighbors ready to pounce on Iraq with a large conventional army equipped with lots of tanks, artillery, and aircraft. And if there were, tanks and artillery and aircraft battles are the United States' strong suite. The war for Iraq will be won or lost in street battles. Poole advocates bottom-up squad-focused training and doctrine to defeat the Islamic irregular fighter threat. Because the United States is fighting a war, many of the careerists now recognize that small arms training, squad tactics, and yes, plain old brawling have to be part of the bag of tricks. Marines paid at least lip service to this new old doctrine--now the Army, the Navy, and even the Air Force are conducting realistic and rigorous squad-level training to better-prepare American service members for duty in the Middle East. Trouble is, old habits die hard. Poole recommends that the US goes further, adopting a bottoms-up tactical doctrine that is ""circumstantially unique, surprise oriented, and threat compensating."" This will shift a larger burden to junior leaders. The biggest shift will be to the individual soldier or Marine on patrol--currently, the capability to run each fire-team size patrol (four or five soliders) from the White House exists. There is a great temptation to do so, even though President Bush was a fighter pilot, not an infantry team leader. Poole argues that the man on the spot is better able to decide what action to take. He's correct as long as the man on the spot has both situational awareness (something that is hard or impossible to do by remote control) and has the other information needed to make the dicision. Plus one more thing--a doctrine that puts decision-making at the lowest possible level. America's most effieicnt industries do this already--the same high-quality people are in business and in our all-volunteer military. It takes time and effort to make a well-rounded knowledgable soldier.It will be a difficult task. Saddam's minions were specifically trained in deception techniques. The laundry list Poole provides in ""Tactics of the Crescent Moon"" read like a James Bond movie: advanced psychological training, mind control techniques, and a ruthlessness not possible if we are to meet American societal norms and what Poole terms ""moral behavior."" One section of Chapter 11 is titled, ""Tactics and Morality Are Not Mutually Exclusive.""The Islamic warrior can be beaten. Poole examines the tactical shortcomings of several Islamic jihad groups. A major problem with the Islamic imperial movement is that the jihadists must play first to the Islamic world. It isn't that the jihadists are ineffective playing to a Western audience--they are many times more effective at the media game against the West than the West is against the Islamic world. The guerrilla theater bombing of Madrid did cause the withdrawal of Spanish soldiers. Kidnapping foreigners and holding them hostage until a Western government complies isn't working out very well now, but held great promise while it was still novel. More effective is that the kidnappings have slowed down the flood of foreign workers into Iraq--there's more to winning a guerrilla campaign than killing American soldiers. Guerrilla war is a war of ideas and images.Poole identifies a major weakness of American forces: movement skills. How can American infantry move through a foreign urban area unseen? The jihadists do so routinely. Some elements, such as Al Queda, have recently began losing their ""invisibility cloak"" because they're outsiders and don't blend in as well as the insiders. Al Queda's operations have been increasingly directed at Iraqi civilians--the US forces are bottled up in their fortified bastions and there are fewer foreign workersl By necessity of having to act, and having driven off most of the targets, Al Queda has to conduct ethnic cleansing, and is alienating Iraq as a result. The US is not only increasing its mobility when it does patrol, but increasingly the new Iraqi police and Iraqi army are becoming more effective at confronting and destroying Al Queda and other insurgency movements. The number one problem in Iraq is still criminal gangs. This fragmented opposition to the new Iraqi government is compartmented by accident and has trouble coordinating large-scale operations, but is resistant to disruption because the many elements are seperated from each other. In many cases the seperate elements are actualy bitter hereditary enemies--temporarily united to fight the ""Crusader"" invaders. The fragility of this alliance is off-set by the fact that all these insurgency movements are self-contained. If Al Queda was smashed today, it would be a body blow to the insurgency, but not a knock-out punch. The insurgents use the Iraqi population as a shield and data bank. US artillery crews are being used as infantry because the cannon shells are not very useful in this war, but infantry patrols are indespensible.Will the US military establishment finally follow the model of Heinlein's 1956 novel, ""Starship Trooper?"" Heinlein's elite force was the Mobile Infantry, a handful of high-tech troops that applied force surgically in surprise raids that combined speed, stealth, firepower, and intelligence. When one of these four was missing, the raid came to grief. In that novel, the most dangerous enemies, the ""bugs,"" moved underground unseen (much like the Oriental warriors in Poole's books) and defeated Earth's soldiers in close combat where the humans were at a disadvantage. The hero of that novel, a sergeant named Zim, used initiative and on-the-spot situational awareness to capture a ""bug brain,"" winning a hard-fought campaign. Heinlein's novels showcased the strengths and weaknesses that Poole's book discusses--both American and Oriental warrior. The Islamic warrior is not as readily identifiable as Heinlein's bug warriors. The Islamic terrorist is no hive creature--and the hive in that science fiction novel proved to be crafty and innovative.One last note--suicide warriors are nothing new for American GI's. The Japanese kamakazi was the most-organized and may be the most famous example, but he wasn't the first. Many American Indian tribes ritually purified their warrior's souls before battle--the warrior didn't enter battle to die, but was already dead. This freed him from worrying about death and made him more effective. The US cavalry was more worried about catching fleeing Indian bands than encountering ""suicidal"" Indian braves. In the Philippines, the Moro ritually prepared himself to enter Paradise prior to running amok with a barong among US troops. About the same time, the Boxers in China underwent pre-battle preparation that made them ""immune"" to bullets and was more or less funeral rites. Despite being ""godless communists,"" the Chinese and North Korean soldiers sometimes used the suicide option, complete with body bomb. The Viet Cong and NVA were credited with doing this frequently. My question is why American soldiers are not better-prepared to face this common threat. Suicide bombers proved to be cost-effective in lives for the PLO--one truck bomb took out the Marine barracks in Beruit and killed over 240 Americans. One PLO suicide driver died. The American response was to bomb a refugee camp--two aircraft shot down, two naval aviators killed, and one captured--and zero PLO fighters were in the camp. Given the disparity in firepower, the suicide bomber seems to be a lifesaver for the insurgency movement. Non-suicide ambushes between American forces and insurgents in Iraq typically end one of two ways--the insurgents escape inflicting few casualties, or the insurgents get wiped out while inflicting multiple American casualties. One successful Iraqi tactic is to drive a car bomb into an American convoy. Because many of the drivers are now contractor personnel, the suicide bomber may only kill some poor kid from Pakistan or another Islamic country--but suicide bombers die so that the insurgency can strike blows with minimal losses. Sometimes a car bomb will kill four or five American servicemen and make headlines.Poole mentions how the human wave attack seems to disregard human life, but actually is a smart, life-sparing tactic for America's Oriental enemies. Rather than wasting the lives of the Iraqi insurgency, suicide bombers seem to be a cost-effective way of killing the intended target, and have the bonus of psychological impact on the Western media, and the American soldier. So why is America still surprised by ruthless, violent, often suicidal close-range attack?",1

Clark,97/128,3.0,1111017600,"A Simple, Concise New Thought Classic","This little booklet was published in the early twentieth century by an anonymous author referred to only by his initials R.H.J. The content is clearly within the parameters of ""New Thought"" literature. For those unfamiliar with New Thought Metaphysics, I recommend reading ""New Thought: A Practical American Spirituality"" by Anderson & Whitehouse as an introduction. The booklet is deliberately short for easy understanding and conscious use of the mental, karmic ""Law"" of causality (""the cause of failure or success""), which some authors call the ""law of attraction"", that is related to what the author calls your ""Omnipotent Power"". Reference is made to ""The Law of Psychic Phenomena"" by Thomson Jay Hudson, an influential nineteenth-century book that is referenced in other New Thought-related books such as Haanel's The Master Key System, Bristol's The Magic of Believing, and Stone & Hill's Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude. The author uses Mr. Hudson's distinction between the ""objective mind"" (which some call the conscious mind, outer mind, or carnal mind, the last from the biblical letters of the Apostle Paul) and the ""subjective mind"" (which some call the subconscious mind, the inner mind or, to use biblical terms, the spirit or soul).Contrary to some writers, the author associates the subjective mind with Omnipotent Power which he calls ""Emmanuel (God in us)"". He fails to distinguish, as do some, between one's subconscious mind which is finite and fallible, and the superconscious Mind (or God), located both within and without, which is Infinite and Infallible. This is an important distinction and is recognized (with various interpretations) even in occult books such as Amber K's True Magick, which also uses the distinguishing terms of Lower Self (the subconscious), Middle Self (the self-conscious), and High or Higher Self (the superconscious).The author states the objective mind (which is tied to outward appearances) is ""the mind you use every day"", and this ""mind and will are so vacillating that you usually only WISH for things and the wonderful, capable power within you does not function"". Wishing is associated with half-hearted wanting in contrast to real, persistent and earnest desiring that, if one follows the three positive rules of ""The Plan"", produces faith in the subjective mind that guarantees results. The objective mind also involves the ""natural and ancient enemy"" of Discredit which uses doubt that acts as an adversary to faith. It is this enemy that makes knowing what you REALLY want and training your objective mind ""no easy task"". According to Wattles in his book, The Science of Getting Rich: ""Every man has the natural and inherent power to think what he wants to think, but it requires far more effort to do so than it does to think the thoughts which are suggested by appearances. To think according to appearances is easy, to think truth regardless of appearances is laborious, and requires the expenditure of more power than any other work man is called upon to perform."" Wattles continues: ""There is no labor from which most people shrink as they do from that of sustained and consecutive thought, it is the hardest work in the world. This is especially true when truth is contrary to appearances."" Words to the wise: Beware of being your own worst enemy. The enemy of doubt is the primary reason why one should not talk to anyone about one's plan which is the third positive rule. The author fails to explain this, although he does so in his later book (mentioned below). In the later book he says: ""The reason is two-fold. If you have been unsuccessful, most of your listeners will agree with you that the plan is foolish. If successful and you tell about it, they will doubt you; and unless you have a firm conviction of this truth you may lose the faith you have gained."" Also, John McDonald in his book, The Message of a Master, gives another reason for silence: ""When you persistently hold to your goal, and keep absolutely air-tight secretiveness, the Outer Mind [the same as R.H.J.'s objective mind] finds no escape for its increasing energy, and in desperation it plunges through, like the overload of steam through the safety valve of a boiler, and your objective is reached."" He expounds on this opposing energy from the outer/objective mind and how to use it constructively. Remember, ""Silence is Golden"" because it fosters faith! (See also what the Apostle Paul says in Romans and Galatians about the ""flesh"" (KJV) or ""sinful nature"" (NIV) and how it wars against the spirit/Spirit within.)The second positive rule of accomplishment is ""think of what you want as often as possible."" This rule involves persistent thought, but it fails to specifically include the principle of visualization of one's earnest desires as already obtained, a principle that is emphasized by Napoleon Hill, Wallace Wattles, Charles Haanel, John McDonald, and others. The author also fails to address the possibility of disappointment where some of one's sincere, earnest desires will NOT come to pass. The reason is because something BETTER may come along to REPLACE them so that, as Wattles said, ""the seeming failure was really a great success"". Wattles discusses this in his book in the chapter on cautions and concluding observations. This principle of replacement may also mean getting the better things AFTER PHYSICAL DEATH which, of course, means that one must believe in an afterlife. R.H.J. talks of an afterlife, but only negatively where obtaining some desires may ""rob you of eternal life"", and he doesn't explain what exactly this means (hell? annihilation?).For those who enjoyed this booklet, R.H.J. has written another, longer and out-of-print work that better explains some things within and underlying It Works. It is the superior of the two! The book is titled ""The Meaning of the Mark"" which refers to a certain symbol or mark of a cross and square (involving the divine & human, heaven & earth relations - which reminds me of the compass over the square in the Masonic symbol and the Hermetic principle of ""As Above, So Below"". See also Matthew 6:10 in Eugene Peterson's version of the Bible, The Message, which translates ""on earth as it is in heaven"" as ""as above, so below""!). This cross-square symbol was on the cover of the earlier printings of It Works, but is now missing, probably since it isn't discussed in the booklet. The later book will ""open up"" the earlier booklet, if you can find it. Thanks Wayne for bringing it to my attention and letting me borrow your copy!",1

"Garry Kasparov on Fischer: Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors, Part 4","This book brings together the two greatest names in the history of chess. The author, Garry Kasparov, is the world number one and, by common consent, the greatest player ever. The subject of the book, Bobby Fischer, is the only American to have become world champion and is probably the greatest natural talent the world has ever seen.In the period between 1955 and 1972 Fischer, more or less single-handedly, took on the might of the Soviet Chess Empire, and won. During this time Fischer scored astonishing successes the like of which had not been seen before. These included 11/11 in the 1963/64 US Championship and match victories (en route to the World Championship) by the score of 6-0 against two of the strongest players in the world, Mark Taimanov and Bent Larsen. The climax of Fischer's campaign was his unforgettable match win in Reykjavik in 1972 against Boris Spassky. Fischer is almost equally well-known for his temperamental behaviour away from the board, as his play on it. He made extreme demands of all those around him including tournament organisers. When these demands were not met he often refused to play. The 1972 match against Spassky required the intervention of no less than Henry Kissinger to smooth things over. In 1975 when he was due to defend his title against Anatoly Karpov, Fischer was completely unable to agree terms with FIDE (the World Chess Federation) and was defaulted. After this he more or less gave up chess, playing only once, a 'return' match against Spassky in 1992. In this book, a must for all serious chessplayers, Kasparov analyses deeply Fischer's greatest games and assesses the legacy of this great American genius.",['Garry Kasparov'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zvqkxQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=zvqkxQEACAAJ&dq=Garry+Kasparov+on+Fischer:+Garry+Kasparov+on+My+Great+Predecessors,+Part+4&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",,2020-06-15,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=zvqkxQEACAAJ&dq=Garry+Kasparov+on+Fischer:+Garry+Kasparov+on+My+Great+Predecessors,+Part+4&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Games & Activities'],,1857443950,30.49,A38F16XP0P76LO,"A.J. Goldsby I ""A.J.G.""",97/126,3.0,1105747200,Garry ... slam-dunks Bobby Fischer,"I recently received my copy of the book - and it has been like a new toy at Christmas, I can hardly put it down. The focus of this book is the one and only Bobby Fischer, many consider this player be simply the greatest chess master who ever lived. And there have not been many good books on this player recently - GM Andy Soltis's book, (""B.F. Rediscovered""); being one happy exception.This eagerly anticipated book is well crafted, a high-quality volume designed for many years of enjoyment. Every fan of either Garry or Fischer will definitely want to reserve a spot for this work on their favorite bookshelf. (And Garry has corrected earlier mistakes; this effort actually has several indexes and a bibliography.)This volume is really two books in one. The first part of this work is devoted to three players: Sammy Reshevsky, Miguel Najdorf, and Bent Larsen. (Three of the greatest non-Soviet players of the last 100 years.) This part of the book looks to be excellent, I am sure that there are many, many, many hours of enjoyment to be had in this section.However, I purchased this volume for the look at Fischer - this is the part that holds my attention and fascination. Fast forward to Chapter Two on, 'Robert, the Eleventh.'This section begins with a rather startling revelation - I had heard rumors of this before, but never anything resembling actual confirmation. There is a fairly decent biography; it details Bobby's first steps with chess poignantly and accurately. The first game, (# 50); is a rather lukewarm analysis of one of Fischer's most famous games. (Vs. Donald Byrne, New York; 1956. ""The Game of The Century."") {See my web page for a more complete analysis of this game.}Another thing you should understand is that I have been studying chess my whole life, I grew up with the book, ""My Sixty Memorable Games."" I am intimately familiar with most of these games, many I have studied so often that they feel like old friends to me. And they are also semi-sacred to me, without a study of these great contests, I am sure I would have never become a Master myself. This is why I object to this &lt;Modern School> of annotating. (Anytime a minuscule improvement is found, this gives the writer license to decorate time-honored chess moves with undeserved question marks.) As in previous volumes, Kasparov shows a heavy, ham-handedness in his annotations. He virtually suffocates and degrades these games with all kinds of appellations to the various moves. Consider game # 52, page # 222. (Versus Larsen, 1958 - a famous Dragon. This game was beautifully annotated by Fischer himself.) For example, he gives White's 15th move a dubious mark. (?!) I think here it is more of a question of style, Fischer would almost never willingly block in his own Bishops. In fact, one wonders if Garry's own ego would ever allow him to be truly objective. He seems determined to criticize and denounce Bobby Fischer, (and his play) ... as if in an effort to cement his own place in chess history.There are other things about this book that I object to as well. After Fischer's famous contest with Panno, (Game # 80, page # 346); Garry just could not resist sticking in one of his own games. Like a little kid who craves recognition for his work - ""See? Look what I did?"" This is SUPPOSED to be a book about Bobby Fischer! (Lack of focus. Again!)I decided to take one game in this book, and subject every move to the microscope of the computer. (Vs. B. Spassky, 1972. # 103, page # 438) I was hoping to find zero errors, but alas this was not the case. I found mistakes that ranged from the very minor, to the more moderate type, and at least one that must go into the, ""My Goodness!! What happened there?"" category. (I will save the details for the next update of my web page on this very famous game.) Kasparov certainly recognizes this game's importance, just the fact that he spends like seven pages scrutinizing it is significant; as well as the 8-10 exclams that he uses to decorate the various moves in this titanic clash. IF you want a different perspective on this game, see GM Yasser Seirawan's excellent book, ""Winning Chess Brilliancies.""I must also take issue with the statement made after Black's fourteenth move, 14...a6. He quotes a famous game - Timman vs. Geller, Hilversum, NED; 1973. Then he states that this game: ""Practically speaking, put the 8.cxd5 variation out of use."" This is such a silly, foolish and stupid statement; I feel obligated to take Mr. Kasparov to task on this one.I have practically every reference book ever printed in English, and I have 1-2 dozen books on the Queen's Gambit Declined alone. The latest book on this opening calls 8.cxd5, {still} ""the time-honored main line."" Dozens of players still use this move on a regular basis. [See the game: GM S. Mamedyarov (2657) - GM S. Lputian (2634); / FIDE WCh, KO / Tripoli, LBA; (Round 2.4), 22,06,2004.] If this line isn't being used anymore, why are these two top players ... still fooling around with it? And the real punch-line is that the column in MCO-14 on 8.cxd5, is based on the following encounter: IM Luc Winants - GM Garry Kasparov; Brussels, 1987!!!This book is definitely better - especially in terms of the quality of analysis - than many of the previous efforts, but it is far from perfect. The editorial/product description calls this book: ""a must for all serious chess players."" (I would definitely not go that far!) However, it is fair to say that this is a serious chess book, any player who is serious about improving his game or is interested in the history of chess - would benefit from a close study of the historic chess battles in this volume. But it falls far short of Garry's previous work in books like, ""The Test of Time."" (Recommended.)",1

Jos. Smith, Jr., founder of the Mormon movement (whose largest branch is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Utah), claimed to receive it by divine revelation. It professes to be the history of ancient inhabitants of the Americas, who came to the New World centuries before Christ.Upon first blush, the Book of Mormon seems to be little more than a pale imitation of the Bible written in exaggerated King James English (by the time your done with it, you won't want to hear the phrase &quot;and it came to pass&quot; again). Nonetheless, the book is quite complicated and appears unlikely to be the work of the generally unlettered Jos. Smith. What is most interesting about the Book is its complex nature. Opponents of the Book have had a hard time finding internal inconsistencies in it, although it has a fair number of anachronisms.Although the LDS Church has produced competent apologists (such as the brilliant B.H. Roberts), the age of modern Mormons apologetics began with Hugh Nibley and has continued to the present with scholars associated with FARMS, now part of BYU. For example, while Jos. Smith believed that the events narrated in the Book of Mormon concerned the territory covered by North and South America, contemporary Mormon scholarship asserts that its events took place in a relatively small area of Central America. There is no archaeological evidence to support the authenticity of the Book, but it does appear to have numerous parallels to ancient Middle Eastern works.Prof. Givens, who is professor of English at the University of Richmond, has written a comprehensive book about the Book of Mormon. It isn't a commentary on the Book of Mormon, but a background work on the role of the Book of Mormon in the Latter-day Saints Church, its authorship, and the controversy about it &quot;revelatory significance&quot; (i.e., whether or not it's inspired). It's fairly dense, but it I'm not aware of a work that provides such useful background information to anyone who wants to study the Book of Mormon or who has some familiarity with it.",1

Watchdogs of Democracy?: The Waning Washington Press Corps and How It Has Failed the Public,"In the course of more than sixty years spent covering Washington politics, Helen Thomas has witnessed a raft of fundamental changes in the way news is gathered and reported. Gone are the days of frequent firsthand contact with the president. Now, the press sees the president only at tightly controlled and orchestrated press conferences. In addition, Thomas sees a growing -- and alarming -- reluctance among reporters to question government spokesmen and probe for the truth. The result has been a wholesale failure by journalists to fulfill what is arguably their most vital role in contemporary American life -- to be the watchdogs of democracy. Today's journalists, according to Thomas, have become subdued, compromised lapdogs. Here, the legendary journalist and bestselling author delivers a hard-hitting manifesto on the precipitous decline in the quality and ethics of political reportage -- and issues a clarion call for change. Thomas confronts some of the most significant issues of the day, including the jailing of reporters, the conservative swing in television news coverage, and the administration's increased insistence on ""managed"" news. But she is most emphatic about reporters' failure to adequately question President George W. Bush and White House spokesmen about the lead-up to the invasion of Iraq, and on subjects ranging from homeland security to the economy. This, she insists, was a dire lapse. Drawing on her peerless knowledge of journalism, Washington politics, and nine presidential administrations, as well as frank interviews with leading journalists past and present, Thomas provides readers with a rich historical perspective on the roots of American journalism, the circumstances attending the rise and fall of its golden age, and the nature and consequences of its current shortcomings. The result is a powerful, eye-opening discourse on the state of political reportage -- as well as a welcome and inspiring demand for meaningful and lasting reform.",['Helen Thomas'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lixOlrqPeqoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=lixOlrqPeqoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Watchdogs+of+Democracy%3F:+The+Waning+Washington+Press+Corps+and+How+It+Has+Failed+the+Public&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Simon and Schuster,2006-12-01,http://books.google.com/books?id=lixOlrqPeqoC&dq=Watchdogs+of+Democracy%3F:+The+Waning+Washington+Press+Corps+and+How+It+Has+Failed+the+Public&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],3.0,B000N2HBT8,,A2YNSRWMTS4UFN,Jeffrey R.

Through her decades-long coverage of the White House, she details the war against the press by every president: but she reserves a special place for the sleazy practices of both Richard Nixon and George Bush. Her conclusion at every turn is that the current press is indeed failing America through cowardice, sloppiness, corporate bottom lines and pandering - they are forgetting that they occupy an essential place in our democracy, questioning those in power.I have had the personal pleasure of meeting and talking with Ms. Thomas in an informal gathering, and she, not failed directors of the CIA, deserves a Medal of Freedom for her long and great service to truth -- pretty unthinkable from the current administration.",1

Now a classic of its genre, The End of Poverty distills more than thirty years of experience to offer a uniquely informed vision of the steps that can transform impoverished countries into prosperous ones. Marrying vivid storytelling with rigorous analysis, Sachs lays out a clear conceptual map of the world economy. Explaining his own work in Bolivia, Russia, India, China, and Africa, he offers an integrated set of solutions to the interwoven economic, political, environmental, and social problems that challenge the world's poorest countries. Ten years after its initial publication, The End of Poverty remains an indispensible and influential work. In this 10th anniversary edition, Sachs presents an extensive new foreword assessing the progress of the past decade, the work that remains to be done, and how each of us can help. He also looks ahead across the next fifteen years to 2030, the United Nations' target date for ending extreme poverty, offering new insights and recommendations.",['Jeffrey D.

Mccord,97/121,5.0,1111017600,John Zxerce's comment,"I would just like to clarify 2 issues regarding Mr. Zxerce's comment on U.S. development assistance.First, using numbers from 2000 (as Mr. Zxerce does), the OECD reports that the U.S. gave only $7.4 billion in net official development assistance. Mr. Zxerce claims the government gave $22.6 billion (a number from a USAID report) which includes all money going to developing countries, most of which does not go towards development purposes (a lot goes to Israel; military education, training, and loans; and antiterrorism). The issue is not to focus on total government flows to developing countries, but to report how much of it is actually going towards development (to make investments in health, education, and infrastructure, for example). Prof. Sachs' recent Foreign Affairs piece ""The Development Challenge"" takes a very detailed look at how U.S. aid is used, showing how little actually makes it to the ground for real development. The article will help clarify most of these points, and can be downloaded at www.sachs.earth.columbia.edu under ""Publications""Second, the USAID report that Mr. Zxerce's numbers come from claims that private giving to developing countries was $33.6 billion in 2002. However, this is misleading because $18 billion of this amount is individual remittances, which are not development aid at all but income transfers between family members in the United States and abroad. Counting remittances as development assistance would be tantamount to counting incomes of American expatriates sent back to the U.S. as international assistance from the rest of the world to the U.S.I hope people take time to read the book carefully, as it will help clarify the issues of how much the United States actually gives, and how an increased American effort could help meet the Millennium Development Goals and make a safer and more prosperous world.",1

In Patagonia,"Gives an account of Bruce Chatwin's journey through Patagonia, where he searched for almost-forgotten legends, Butch Cassidy's log cabin, and the descendants of Welsh immigrants.",['Bruce Chatwin'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fdPswAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=fdPswAEACAAJ&dq=In+Patagonia&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin Group USA,2003,http://books.google.com/books?id=fdPswAEACAAJ&dq=In+Patagonia&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Travel'],42.0,0671400452,,A1LFK2BKT02Q5S,Caitlin Johnson,97/118,3.0,1109894400,A unique portrait of a unique land,"In December 1947, Bruce Chatwin began a journey through Patagonia, a ""vast, vague territory that encompasses 900,000 square kilometres of Argentina and Chile."" As he wandered, Chatwin recorded the stories of the people he met and those who had gone before him; ""fugitives of justice, regime change, or simply 'the coop of England.'"" The result was In Patagonia, an instant classic that was described as ""a law unto itself.""Thirty years later, I landed in Puerto Montt, Chile at the northwestern edge of Patagonia and started my own journey through that windswept country. I toted In Patagonia along with me as I traveled through Patagonia; resolving every few days to read it, only to put in down in favor of more entertaining books after the first few pages. Despite the book's inability to really grab my attention, I had this unshakable notion that if one has a book titled In Patagonia and one is, in fact, in Patagonia, one should read the book. (This was coupled with the fact that I had used precious cargo space to haul the book 6,000 miles from home and I was damn well going to make use of it.) It wasn't until the end of the journey, while bussing it across Patagonia, that I packed all of my books *except* In Patagonia in the backpack that was stored underneath of the bus. Upon arriving in Punta Arenas ten hours later, I still didn't like In Patagonia, but I had read over a hundred pages and felt honor bound to stick it out for the rest of the book.Paul Theroux best sums up what I didn't like about In Patagonia: ""How had he traveled from here to there? How had he met this or that person? Life was never so neat as Bruce made out."" In Patagonia isn't Chatwin's account of his travels through Patagonia so much as it is a collection of biographic narratives of people who have nothing in common except their inhabitance in Patagonia. There is no sense of cohesion to the book. Chatwin bounces from the story of two long-dead bandits to the possible existence of a Patagonian unicorn to the struggles of an Haight-Ashbury Flower Child stranded in Argentina to a traditional Argentinean asado then returns to further exploits of the outlaws, leaving me slightly bewildered and lost.Nor does Chatwin dwell on most of his tales. A few accounts, such as the self proclaimed King of Patagonia and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, earned multiple chapters, but most stories were no more that a brief sketch, confined to no more than a page. I know this was a conscious stylistic choice of Chatwin, but the snippets left me feeling unsatisfied and wondering what their point was.While I wasn't overly impressed with Chatwin's style, the main reason I continued the read In Patagonia was because in between the snippets, there was some fascinating stories. In 1859, a French lawyer called Or&eacute;lie-Antoine de Tounens declared himself king of Araucania and Patagonia, a kingdom that stretches from Latitude 42 South to Cape Horn and still maintains a court in exile in Paris. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid fled to Patagonia to avoid arrest in the States, but reverted to a life of crime and pulled off several successful robberies before they supposedly died in a shoot-out in Bolivia. In Patagonia reveals ""the Patagonian origin of Coleridge's Ancient Mariner, Darwin's theory of evolution, Shakespeare's Caliban, Dante's Hell, Conan Doyle's Lost World, Swift's Brobdignagians, Poe's Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym. Even the Patagonian origin of Man himself."" These stories propelled me through the dull bits to the end of the book.Furthermore, my original assessment, that I should read In Patagonia while in Patagonia, was correct and there were times when I found myself nodding and agreeing with Chatwin's descriptions and assessments. In other parts, the thirty years between Chatwin's trip and mine had wrought profound changes and Chatwin's account and mine didn't remotely match up, demonstrating the political upheaval of South America in the latter part of the twentieth century.There is also something thrilling about reading the story of town you're currently in or have just left. During my bus journey home, I changed busses in Puerto Natalas and spend the hour between my arrival and departure wandering around the town. I stopped at the town plaza as I walked back to the bus station. In the centre of the plaza was a raised dais with a train engine sitting atop it. Back on the bus, I read Chatwin's account of his trip to the town, which included the origins of the train:""Puerto Natalas was a Red town ever since the meat-works opened up. The English built the meat-works during the First World War, four miles along the bay, where deep water ran inshore. They build a railway to bring the men to work; and when the place ran down, the citizens painted the engine and put it in the plaza - an ambiguous memorial.""Nicholas Shakespeare, who wrote the introduction to my copy of In Patagonia, described Chatwin saying, ""Bruce Chatwin was always attracted to border countries: to places on the rim of the world, sandwiched ambiguously between cultures, neither one thing nor another."" I am very much the same way and despite the negative aspects of In Patagonia, Chatwin did capture the wild, untamed abandon that is my Patagonia.",1

That is, most of our planetary brothers and sisters live in earthen houses that rely on renewable human labor and local resources like mud, straw, rock and tree. These houses are less energy intensive, more durable, and are often more esthetically pleasing than so-called &quot;modern&quot; homes, as this book shows.&quot;The Art of Natural Building&quot; questions the environmental responsibility of a 5,000-sq-foot, 500,000-dollar house. As more and more people begin to make the kind of money it takes to buy their own American Dream house, we must question the feasibility our of contemporary building practices. Would it be possible cover the globe with modern homes? Building companies certainly think so, but aside from what a project of this immensity what mean environmentally, the resources are simply not available.There is simply not enough lumber, brick, cement, and processed material to go around. Our building industry would gladly sell us into oblivion if it meant a buck or two in the short-haul, but we need to get away from this kind of thinking. We also need to consider the environmental impacts of our current practices. What are these impacts?As this book reminds us, buildings already account for one quarter of the world's wood harvest, two-fifths of its material and energy use, and one-six of its fresh water usage. In the past 100 years the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has risen 27 percent, one-quarter of which has come the burning of fossil fuels just to provide energy for buildings. During the same period, the world lost more than 20 percent of its forest. Quite simply, our building philosophy is not sustainable; and with a populaiton of 6 billion rising at an incredible rate every year, reconstruction of this philosophy becomes all the more timely and important.We can start by dropping out of the rat race and getting our hands dirty. Natural building is much more affordable, durable, environmentally responsible and estheticly pleasing than the track homes and skyscrapers advancing on the horizon. We can also avoid the loan-mortgage game which weds us to unfulfilling job and Sisyphus-like existence. We can create spaces that are non-toxic, unique, and ecologically sound. And perhaps most importantly, we can reconnect with Earth and the spirit of artisanship.Along with the philosophy, you will discover a veritable treasure trove of natural building styles and ideas, from the radically new and innovative - like concept &quot;earthship&quot; - to the ancient and elegant, such as the living roof pictured on the cover. Architects need not apply, nor must you be good with your hands to fashion your own natural house. I consider myself very fortunate to have seen this book before investing in a home of my own. Like many people, I might have ended up working the rest of my life to pay for &quot;a house without a clue.&quot;By far and away, this is one of the most important books I have ever read. Philosophers dabble with theories of justice, beauty and truth, but with this book you will discover how all of these ideas can be BUILT into the very structure and fabric of your life. You will discover the ethics and aesthetics of building design and ecological living.Filled to the brim with great references, links and some amazing photographs to stimulate your right brain, &quot;The Art of Natural Building&quot; is a must for anybody interested in saving the planet and saving a little money at the same time. The ultimate ecological building encyclopedia! A must read for all dwelling creatures.",1

The lifetime reading plan,"Now in print for the first time in almost 40 years, The New Lifetime Reading Plan provides readers with brief, informative and entertaining introductions to more than 130 classics of world literature. From Homer to Hawthorne, Plato to Pascal, and Shakespeare to Solzhenitsyn, the great writers of Western civilization can be found in its pages. In addition, this new edition offers a much broader representation of women authors, such as Charlotte Bront%, Emily Dickinson and Edith Wharton, as well as non-Western writers such as Confucius, Sun-Tzu, Chinua Achebe, Mishima Yukio and many others. This fourth edition also features a simpler format that arranges the works chronologically in five sections (The Ancient World; 300-1600; 1600-1800; and The 20th Century), making them easier to look up than ever before. It deserves a place in the libraries of all lovers of literature.","['Clifton Fadiman', 'John S.

Clifton Fadiman, who also gave us THE WINE BUYER'S GUIDE &amp; THE JOYS OF WINE, shows a sincere love for books, yet he is unfortunately one of the most ridiculous critics I have ever encountered. He consistently sounds far too pompous and misplaces his emphasis left and right. He tells us that Shakespeare should not be studied and is frequently pretentious and obscure; he says that Milton wrote in an often lackluster foreign language; he declares that Dickens is tedious and produced one of his worst novels in A TALE OF TWO CITIES; and he implies that DON QUIXOTE is something you should read in the 50-page version for children. After leaving us a bit ambivalent about those who have long been considered the greatest writers ever, he goes on the exalt Nabokov, Camus, and James Boswell (merely fine writers relative to the former ones).Reading Cliff Fadiman is like listening to a history professor tell you that Jefferson, Lincoln, and FDR were really mediocre presidents, but that Garfield and Coolidge were enlightened and really got a hell of a lot done.I hate to be so negative, but there are just so many better books than Fadiman's on the same subject.If you are looking for a lifetime reading plan and an inspiring critic, I suggest you try Harold Bloom (THE WESTERN CANON, SHAKESPEARE: THE INVENTION OF THE HUMAN, HOW TO READ AND WHY).After you read Bloom's chapters on Cervantes, Milton, Dickens, and above all Shakespeare, go back and read Fadiman's sections on these authors.

Cahill shows us Jesus from his birth to his execution through the eyes of those who knew him and in the context of his time—a time when the Jews were struggling to maintain their beliefs under overlords who imposed their worldview on their subjects. Here is Jesus the loving friend, itinerate preacher, and quiet revolutionary, whose words and actions inspired his followers to journey throughout the Roman world and speak the truth he instilled—in the face of the greatest defeat: Jesus' crucifixion as a common criminal. Daring, provocative, and stunningly original, Cahill's interpretation will both delight and surprise.

For a book about Jesus, the writing style is somewhat cavalier; not unfunny, mind you, but in the context of the discussions, out of place. If the style is somewhat disconcerting, the contents are downright disturbing. This is not a scholarly book. Indeed, it is full of errors and oversights, and on occasion, bad taste. For example...""Since scholars can no longer consult it [the Aramaic version of Matthew], they have given to this putative source the name ""Q""... (p. 75)."" Nonsense. The Q document is not the lost version of Matthew. Q is a hypothetical construct designed to address the communalitiues in Matthew and Luke that cannot be found in Mark.""Its origins [the Gospel of Matthew] ...may well lie with such an eyewitness (p. 75)."" That's right. Mark and Matthew both wrote their Gospels. And I have a bridge I'd like to sell you. It is fairly well established that the Gospels were written many years after Jesus' death, and the number of errors in them clearly show that they are not eyewitness accounts.""Gehenna...pyres were kept burning for this purpose [burning children]. (p. 80)."" In fact, Gehenna was a garbage dump and the burning fires were used to dispose of the waste, which included dead people.""She [Mary] was..no more than fourteen or so... (p. 95)."" The fact is no one has any idea how old she was, except that she was a ""young woman"" and that most Jewish woman in the 1st century BC married at the age of 12.""...kataluma which means a room occupied by human being. (p. 99)."" Yes, but it also can mean a ""cave"" and there is a wealth of theory and literature supporting the idea that Jesus was born in a cave.Though this book is not without its merits, you have to wonder what its purpose is. While it is well written, there are much better written books, and while it purports to provide some facts, it hardly ranks even as a weak scholarly text. It provides nothing new, and its rewriting of the old is so full of mistakes that it doesn't warrant reading.",1
The Botany of Desire A Plant's-eye View of the World,"The book that helped make Michael Pollan, the New York Times bestselling author of Cooked and The Omnivore’s Dilemma, one of the most trusted food experts in America In 1637, one Dutchman paid as much for a single tulip bulb as the going price of a town house in Amsterdam. Three and a half centuries later, Amsterdam is once again the mecca for people who care passionately about one particular plant—though this time the obsessions revolves around the intoxicating effects of marijuana rather than the visual beauty of the tulip. How could flowers, of all things, become such objects of desire that they can drive men to financial ruin? In The Botany of Desire, Michael Pollan argues that the answer lies at the heart of the intimately reciprocal relationship between people and plants. In telling the stories of four familiar plant species that are deeply woven into the fabric of our lives, Pollan illustrates how they evolved to satisfy humankinds’s most basic yearnings—and by doing so made themselves indispensable. For, just as we’ve benefited from these plants, the plants, in the grand co-evolutionary scheme that Pollan evokes so brilliantly, have done well by us. The sweetness of apples, for example, induced the early Americans to spread the species, giving the tree a whole new continent in which to blossom. So who is really domesticating whom? Weaving fascinating anecdotes and accessible science into gorgeous prose, Pollan takes us on an absorbing journey that will change the way we think about our place in nature.",['Michael Pollan'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=W_L_2yTfOEEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=W_L_2yTfOEEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Botany+of+Desire+A+Plant%27s-eye+View+of+the+World&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Random House,2001-06-12,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=W_L_2yTfOEEC&source=gbs_api,['Nature'],81.0,B000U424PU,,A2EKT379TIWMDY,"""cdnadell""",97/116,3.0,995760000,"A good, but questionable, effort","Pollan's The Botany of Desire is certainly a fascinating book, and I would say that it is also a valuable read, but not for its scientific accuracy or integrity. Firstly, the author is not a scientist but a journalist, and we all know that journalists tend to glorify and exaggerate. His argument itself is attractive in some ways but consistently equivocal and vague. Though skeptical throughout, I did enjoy this book for the author's fluid writing, good sense of humor, and solid attempts and evolutionary insight.Pollan claims that that the plants we domesticate have evolved to please our senses and thus encourage us to grow them in vast amounts, in effect, helping them to propagate. At first, this is a very attractive idea, but with further thought it does not hold up. Are people and the plants they grow commercially really in an obligate mutualistic relationship? Well, yes, they are. Human society, particularly in industrially developed countries, has become dependent on domesticated crops. But I would argue that we have moulded these crops to our own ends; the influence of natural selection upon these crops' ancestors is not as significant as the artificial selection we exerted upon them. Yes, apple trees did first have to get our attention before we would start growing them voluntarily, but we have artificially selected the apples that you and I eat today. Those huge Granny Smiths and Red and Golden Delicious you see at the grocery are not wild type species in the least bit. They are as much a designed piece of technology as is a finely tuned engine, and the orchard in which they grow is not really different from a factory. These domesticated species would never have flourished in a primitive environment, and they are totally defenseless to pests and other threats without the aid of their inventors, us. What difference does this make? We are still producing large numbers of them; isn't that all that counts? Well, you could always say that we are propagating the apples, potatoes, cannabis, whatever, but we produce them on our terms, not theirs. We artificially select the characters we want, and then we clone them by vegetative methods. The plants were not and are not evolving to please us; they are being manipulated to please us. Think about all the seedless fruits we have developed and sustained (grapes, bananas, watermelon, pinneapple, just to name a few). This process is the equivalent of evolutionary castration, reducing these plants to nothing more than a toolbox of malleable biotic mechanisms. They are no longer independently evolving; we sustain them solely for our own benefit, and the genetic lines of the plants themselves are frozen in time.Now that I have griped, I must say that this book is not without its benefits. I had not really thought about plants the way Pollan presents here, and I must thank him for opening my eyes in this respect. Although I don't agree with him, I derived great value in following his thought process about domesticated plants. For this reason, I would recommend this book to those who would like to debate an interesting evolutionary topic that is a nice twist on traditional perspective.",0

Very little or useful competitive strategy is ever explained in the 600 plus pages of purely 1950's Eisenhower era mass marketing and mass media driven brand planning tactics. It's mostly tactics. Written by an academic who never worked his way up in brand management, the book sorely needs to be updated to the realities of modern marketing (e.g. the internet). Missing topics include competitve market analysis section, positioning, targeting, bonding, building communities, internet marketing. In fact, the entire book boils down one theme according to Kevin, &quot;you can build brands with strong, favorable and unique brand associations.&quot; That's mentioned hundreds of times in 600 pages. Take it from the students, don't rely on Strategic Brand Management as your definitive source for understanding the strategic power of brand building. A few of his chapters are usable (e.g. brand awareness). My recommendation is to collect a hodgepodge of other titles such as Competitive Marketing Strategy by John Czepiel, The Handbook of Brand Management by David Arnold, Brand Asset Management by Scott Davis, Emotional Bonding by Marc Gobe and books by David Aaker (one of his is enough though as they just repeat).

B. Barnes ""jbbarnes""",97/114,2.0,1102377600,A lightweight book for younger readers,"I think the main problem with this book is the title. It's not about hacking or hackproofing XP; it's about *customizing* it, and mostly in cosmetic ways. Any discussion about enhancing performance or security generally falls in the category of things you likely already know if you've spent a few years working with Windows. Trimming startup apps, turning off services, tightening network security. Good stuff for the beginner, to be sure. Aside from that, there is a lot of emphasis on changing the look and feel of the interface and using shareware apps.One element that may quickly begin to wear on non-teenagers is the level of writing. Practically every section begins something like this: ""Such and such is a cool new feature in Windows XP and looks really great, but sometimes it gets kind of boring to look at, so I'll show you how to change it."" There is also a surprising number of grammatical and spelling mistakes in the book. My advice to the editor: it's hard to take a book seriously with such flabby writing and slangy style. This is a book, not a webpage. When it comes to grossly overused words like cool, neat, and great; I would advise the following formula for how many should be allowed in published material: Take the average age of your target audience, divide by the number of chapters in the book, divide that by the number of topics in each chapter, then multiply by zero.If you are a teenager who's really into themes, skins, fonts, and other eye candy, this is the book for you. You'll also learn some good basic tips about modifying more important parts of your system. But if you're a person who has supported Windows for years and is looking for serious hacks that can be described in ways other than ""cool,"" make sure you flip through the book before buying.",1
Worlds in collision,,,,,,,,,,B0006QUST6,,A1900CRQYJTQSJ,gmorrison@claimsrisk.com,97/113,5.0,923529600,Catastrophe Happens!,"This book is worth the effort. Whether a scholar, or a person with a healthy curiosity, this book should stimulate your brain cells. The book does not roll along like a Tom Clancy novel, but it does describe more chaos and destruction than all his novels combined. We're talking &quot;a disaster of Biblical proportions, Old Testament, Mr. Mayor, real wrath of God type stuff, fire and brimstone coming down from the skies, rivers and seas boiling, 40 years of darkness, earthquakes, volcanoes, . . . dogs &amp; cats living together, mass hysteria&quot; (&quot;Ghostbusters I&quot; but right on target).Reading this book gives the open minded reader the opportunity to view the history of the Earth in a completely new way, and some of our favorite mysteries of the past may be decoded in conjunction with Velikovsky's &quot;theories&quot;. The scientific discoveries of the 49 years since the book was first published have been very kind to Dr. Velikovsky, but not so kind to scientific dogma of the same period).Velikovsky dares to read ancient works literally, and to look for proof of their accuracy, even when they appear flawed. If a document states that the sun rose in the west, Velikovsky is willing to search for proof that it did, instead of presuming the text is flawed. Velikovsky's ideas help to unravel mysteries which cannot be decoded until we are willing to challenge the scientific dogma which presumes that ancient documents are incorrect whenever they disagree with our perceptions of what they ought to say.Will Stonehenge be forever a mystery, because theories that it was built as an astrological computer are dashed by the fact that present planetary orbits do not fit its alignment? Or can we suppose that prehistoric man dragged those stones around, and reset them several times, because keeping up with the wanderings of comets/planets was important to their survival. Is it possible that today Stonehenge does not align because the orbits of stars and planets, relative to the Earth's, have changed?If the errosion on the Sphinx is a result of water, not wind and sand, could this relate to a drastic shift in the Earth's axis since it was built? Could such a shift have caused the sudden decline of Egyptian culture?And have we ever wondered what those Mammoths ate out there on the Siberian tundra? Did they live on lichen and snowcones, or did they eat a few tons of subtropical plants each day (as supported by the stomach contents found in those flash frozen Mammoths found in Siberia in the sixties). And HOW did they get flash frozen so quickly that the meat never spoiled?I first read this book in the seventies, while in college. A theologian at the time suggested I should not read the book, as he felt Velikovsky was trying to show that God did not cause the events recorded in the Bible which so often helped the Jews. I am sure Dr. Velikovsky would not try to prove a negative hypothesis, and I found no evidence of same in the book.It is interesting that all other cultures perceived the comets to be gods, while the Jews saw the comets as messengers of the one God. It is curious that these cataclysms only seemed to help the Jews.The book supports the historical accuracy of the Bible, as well as other religious writings and &quot;mythologies&quot;. This book in worth the effort, as it has a lot to contribute to our own perceptions of nature, history, and religion.",0
TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME,"In this “informative and delightful” (American Scientist) biography, Margaret Cheney explores the brilliant and prescient mind of Nikola Tesla, one of the twentieth century’s greatest scientists and inventors. In Tesla: Man Out of Time, Margaret Cheney explores the brilliant and prescient mind of one of the twentieth century's greatest scientists and inventors. Called a madman by his enemies, a genius by others, and an enigma by nearly everyone, Nikola Tesla was, without a doubt, a trailblazing inventor who created astonishing, sometimes world-transforming devices that were virtually without theoretical precedent. Tesla not only discovered the rotating magnetic field -- the basis of most alternating-current machinery -- but also introduced us to the fundamentals of robotics, computers, and missile science. Almost supernaturally gifted, unfailingly flamboyant and neurotic, Tesla was troubled by an array of compulsions and phobias and was fond of extravagant, visionary experimentations. He was also a popular man-about-town, admired by men as diverse as Mark Twain and George Westinghouse, and adored by scores of society beauties. From Tesla's childhood in Yugoslavia to his death in New York in the 1940s, Cheney paints a compelling human portrait and chronicles a lifetime of discoveries that radically altered -- and continue to alter -- the world in which we live. Tesla: Man Out of Time is an in-depth look at the seminal accomplishments of a scientific wizard and a thoughtful examination of the obsessions and eccentricities of the man behind the science.",['Margaret Cheney'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HIuK7iLO9zgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=HIuK7iLO9zgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=TESLA+MAN+OUT+OF+TIME&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Simon and Schuster,2011-11-08,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HIuK7iLO9zgC&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],7.0,B000NUP2AU,,A10U8DJAPJJI8I,"William Hefner ""William Van Hefner""",97/112,5.0,1031443200,THE Definite Tesla Biography,"The best biography written on one of the most amazing men of the 20th century, or perhaps of all-time.Nikola Tesla was one of the world's greatest inventors, and definitely its most mysterious. To say that Telsa was ahead of his time is putting it rather mildly. Most of his inventions were so advanced that the public had a difficult time grasping just how important they really were.Although Marconi is often credited with the invention of radio, the real credit goes entirely to Tesla. A long-running battle between the two ended when American courts essentially invalidated Marconi's radio patent, and awarded credit for the invention to Nikola Telsla.In addition to radio, Tesla also invented Alternating Current (AC), which is the form of electricity used to deliver power to most homes and businesses on earth. He also patented hundreds of other inventions, many of which are in use today. Others are yet to be understood by modern scientists.Probably just as fascinating as Tesla's inventions was Telsa himself though. He was the original, real-life ""mad scientist"", and often discussed his invention of the ""death ray"" with the popular press. The world has never seen an inventor the likes of Nikola Tesla, and may never see one again. This book is a fascinating look at an amazing individual.",1

For Whom the Bell Tolls,"Ernest Hemingway's masterpiece on war, love, loyalty, and honor tells the story of Robert Jordan, an antifascist American fighting in the Spanish Civil War. In 1937 Ernest Hemingway traveled to Spain to cover the civil war there for the North American Newspaper Alliance. Three years later he completed the greatest novel to emerge from “the good fight” and one of the foremost classics of war literature. For Whom the Bell Tolls tells of loyalty and courage, love and defeat, and the tragic death of an ideal. Robert Jordan, a young American in the International Brigades, is attached to an antifascist guerilla unit in the mountains of Spain. In his portrayal of Jordan’s love for the beautiful Maria and his superb account of a guerilla leader’s last stand, Hemingway creates a work at once rare and beautiful, strong and brutal, compassionate, moving, and wise.

The bleak, non-sexy, self-absorbed world Bushnell attempts to glamourize reveals that not only do blondes not have fun, their roots are showing under the bleach. She must know her novel is not amusing, not light and certainly not Sex in the City where at least the chicks have a laugh with their Cosmopolitans. No laughing here. Hard to believe that I was preparing to feel sorry for myself when I started the book and ended up feeling pretty darn lucky to not be beautiful, young, single and blond in NYC. On the other hand, maybe now the general public will understand the difference between Blonde(noun) and blond(adj.) So, hey, there is some redeeming social value.If you want to read about fun steamy sex, dust off an old copy of Valley of the Dolls. Now there is a bathtub read.Candace Bushnell's Four Blondes may do for marital happiness what Fatal Attraction did for fidelity.",1
"Experience and education, (The Kappa Delta Pi lecture series)","Experience and Education is the best concise statement on education ever published by John Dewey, the man acknowledged to be the pre-eminent educational theorist of the twentieth century. Written more than two decades after Democracy and Education (Dewey's most comprehensive statement of his position in educational philosophy), this book demonstrates how Dewey reformulated his ideas as a result of his intervening experience with the progressive schools and in the light of the criticisms his theories had received. Analyzing both ""traditional"" and ""progressive"" education, Dr. Dewey here insists that neither the old nor the new education is adequate and that each is miseducative because neither of them applies the principles of a carefully developed philosophy of experience. Many pages of this volume illustrate Dr. Dewey's ideas for a philosophy of experience and its relation to education. He particularly urges that all teachers and educators looking for a new movement in education should think in terms of the deeped and larger issues of education rather than in terms of some divisive ""ism"" about education, even such an ""ism"" as ""progressivism."" His philosophy, here expressed in its most essential, most readable form, predicates an American educational system that respects all sources of experience, on that offers a true learning situation that is both historical and social, both orderly and dynamic.",['John Dewey'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JhjPK4FKpCcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=JhjPK4FKpCcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Experience+and+education,+(The+Kappa+Delta+Pi+lecture+series)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Simon and Schuster,2007-11-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JhjPK4FKpCcC&source=gbs_api,['Education'],6.0,B000872TBI,,,,97/111,5.0,934675200,The granddad of your granddad's schooling.,"You can thank Dewey for making all Americans think that school should be relevant to real life and that solving problems is more important than reciting factoids. The man wrote the book on it, and this little book is his effort much later to clarify what he really meant, which is to have a balanced and informed experience, not a forced choice between extremes of the didacticc and the practical. So if you are only going to read one book to find out why he should be remembered (and revered) for much more than a decimal system in the library, read this book. And be ready to become passionate, even political, about liberating our children from factory schools which make them passive and stupid. A good companion book is C.S.

A series of beautifully-written and well-supported essays covers, very quickly, the turn-of-the-millennium status of research on the subject of how life got started at the very, very beginning. How did 'pre-biotic' molecules ever get started replicating themselves, eventually turning into 'biotic' molecules? The answers aren't all in, but there's some really exciting work going on; scientists are relentlessly chipping away at the problem and they have made a surprising amoutn of progress. You know, these days the creationists are getting a lot of press. And they keeep hammering on the idea that the pre-biotic genesis of life is simply impossible; it had to require some sort of divine intervention. This is a lie. Take astronomer Fred Hoyle's famous simile -- that the accidental genesis of life would be like a tornado ripping through a junkyard and assembling a 747. While I read 'Life's Origin', I thought often of Hoyle and how much I'd like to throttle him. The origin of life requires NOTHING like the accidental assembly of a jet aircraft. It requires something much more like the lifting of two magnets into the air, so they can snap together, each magnet's noth pole snapping to the other's south. Molecules have natural affinities. They were 'born' to snap together. 99.9% of all the matter in the universe is either carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, or nitrogen: the stuff of life. Once the Earth had cooled down from its fiery birth, life couldn't wait to get started. And once it got started, it was by its very nature almost unstoppable. This is not an easy book. It's written for a lay audience (and there's a helpful glossary at the back), but there's a ton of orgo in it, so if you're not a chemist you had best be a quick study: the kind of layperson who, having once heard (for example) the word 'racemic' defined, can use it in a coherent sentence the following day. If you're that kind of smart, you will get a real kick out of this book. This crazy world is more beautiful -- life is more strange and fantastic and marvelous, than we ever suspected.

A Universe Of Consciousness: How Matter Becomes Imagination,"In A Universe of Consciousness, Gerald Edelman builds on the radical ideas he introduced in his monumental trilogy-Neural Darwinism, Topobiology, and The Remembered Present-to present for the first time an empirically supported full-scale theory of consciousness. He and the neurobiolgist Giulio Tononi show how they use ingenious technology to detect the most minute brain currents and to identify the specific brain waves that correlate with particular conscious experiences. The results of this pioneering work challenge the conventional wisdom about consciousness.","['Gerald Edelman', 'Giulio Tononi']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NuuKswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=NuuKswEACAAJ&dq=A+Universe+Of+Consciousness:+How+Matter+Becomes+Imagination&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Basic Books,2001-02-28,http://books.google.com/books?id=NuuKswEACAAJ&dq=A+Universe+Of+Consciousness:+How+Matter+Becomes+Imagination&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Psychology'],1.0,0465013767,,AN9WZ89SDFQ70,Ryan Malloy,97/110,3.0,961459200,"Extremely interesting data, dubious conclusions","This book is worthwhile mostly for the wealth of experimental data provided. Unfortunately, I think the authors often jump to conclusions that their evidence neither precludes nor proves. The most pervasive example of faulty logic is the central theme of the book. The authors provide evidence that consciousness is *associated* with vast, interconnected regions of the brain. When a person is aware of a stimulus, more neural areas are active than when he/she is not. From this, they conclude that consciousness *arises* from diverse neural areas in the brain. This is the key fault of the book--the authors do not differentiate between *association* and *origin*. Perhaps conscious activity that occurs in a small area of the brain promotes extracurricular activities elsewhere. Just because two events occur simultaneously does not mean one caused the other!The authors describe their work as a &quot;theory of consciousness&quot;--completely misleading in another sense. Even if we were able to precisely understand what neural processes lead to consciousness, which neurons were involved, etc., the consciousness mystery still would not be solved. The most fascinating and mysterious question is &quot;HOW do the neural processes lead to consciousness?&quot; Uncovering the neural processes associated with consciousness is a great way to begin, perhaps the only way. However, to call the authors' work a &quot;theory of consciousness&quot; is absurd. Imagine a 18th century person able to view the modern automobile through timetravel. Suppose here were able to deduce that turning a key started the automobile, pushing the right pedal made it accelerate, etc. before he was forced to return to his time. Would his knowledge be a &quot;theory of the automobile&quot;? Only in an extremely superficial sense. He would know how the automobile worked, but would have no idea as to the physical mechanisms (e.g. electromagnetism) at play.I DO recommend this book but I strongly suggest that you pay close attention to the *data* and consider it yourself.",1
Philosophical investigations;: The English text of the third edition,One of the most influential philosophical workks of the 20th century.,['Ludwig Wittgenstein'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bMp9tQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=bMp9tQEACAAJ&dq=Philosophical+investigations%3B:+The+English+text+of+the+third+edition&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Pearson College Division,1958,http://books.google.com/books?id=bMp9tQEACAAJ&dq=Philosophical+investigations%3B:+The+English+text+of+the+third+edition&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Philosophy'],,B0006CB92U,,A16QODENBJVUI1,Robert Moore,97/110,5.0,1011312000,One of the two great philosophical works of the 20th century,"The two greatest works of philosophy of the 20th century are, I believe, Wittgenstein's PHILOSOPHICAL INVESTIGATIONS and Heidegger's BEING AND TIME. The famous distinction between Analytical or Anglo-American Philosophy on the one hand, and European or Continental Philosophy is symbolized by these two books. I have to confess that I found the Wittgenstein absolutely fascinating, and has become one of the most important books in my life and library. I have studied the Heidegger, but perhaps because of the extraordinary moral failings in his life (he was a member of the Nazi party from 1933 to 1945, though he apparently was more of a fan of Nazism than Hitler, his great break with Hitler being that he saw the Jewish problem as being an intellectual problem, and not a biological one, i.e., he felt like traditional anti-Semites that Jews need only change their beliefs to be reintegrated into society, while Hitler felt the problem was in their blood, and the only solution was isolation of the Jews or their destruction), or perhaps because of the tortured and obscure mode of writing that he felt he had to use to express his thought, I found the Heidegger to be remote, uninteresting, and inaccessible. Ultimately, not worth the effort. But BEING AND TIMES's status as a classic is incontestable.As a grad student in philosophy at Yale and the University of Chicago, I was subject to a growing conviction that most university professors teaching Wittgenstein should, perhaps, not. The problem is that most American professors teaching Wittgenstein teach him as an extension of Russell, Tarski, and Carnap. Their background is logic, philosophy of mathematics, and philosophy of science, and their philosophy of language is rooted in logical and scientific issues. Although Wittgenstein was interested in these issues, there is a definitive amount of information that indicates that while he possessed a knowledge of mathematics, logic, and philosophy of language, his own philosophical background was much, much broader. His own cultural concerns ran much more broadly than most of these professors. It is not merely that they have not read Kierkegaard, Tolstoy, Lichtenberg, Karl Kraus, Goethe, or the prayers of Samuel Johnson: they have no interest in doing so, and little sympathy for these writers, whom Wittgenstein himself found congenial.One is, therefore, in a dilemma with Wittgenstein. Unless you have taken several courses in philosophy, taking up the PHILOSOPHICAL INVESTIGATIONS can be an almost overwhelming challenge. Most of the books on Wittgenstein are either weak or very misleading because of a lack of sympathy with his wider interests.For an ordinary individual, perhaps well read, but not especially knowledgeable of the work of philosophers like Russell and Frege and against whom he developed much of his thought, my first recommendation would be not to read the PHILOSOPHICAL INVESTIGATIONS, but to read instead Ray Monk's biography of Wittgenstein. This is a excellent biography, and does a very good job of acquainting the casual reader with the highlights of both Wittgenstein's thought and life (and his life was a very interesting one indeed, in contrast to Heidegger, whose life, apart from his involvement with Nazism, was pretty uneventful). I would then recommend that one try reading one of Wittgenstein's other books first. I believe that either ON CERTAINTY or ZETTEL or CULTURE AND VALUE would be a much easier way into Wittgenstein's work than reading the INVESTIGATIONS.",1
AUSTRALIA'S CONSTITUTION,"“The continued usage of the Australian Constitution Act (UK) by the Australian Governments and the judiciary is a confidence trick of monstrous proportions played upon the Australian people with the intent of maintaining power…. Authority over the Australian Constitution Act lies not with the Australian government, nor with the Australian people. It rests solely with the UK. Only they have the authority to repeal this legislation....” - The late Professor G. Clements, UK QC and emeritus Professor in Law at Cambridge University This book is the first of its type to be written in the last 114 years. Nobody has done so since Quick and Garran in 1901. The British Colony of Australia Act (1900) represents Australia's primary law. It is still used today as our Constitution. That Act controls all our lives. The British Government added the first eight parts of this Act and the ninth part is the draft Constitution. That draft was changed by the British Government before they would allow the Act to be presented to their Parliament. This amended Constitution was never presented to the “people” of Australia for their approval. The document is steeped in nineteenth century colonial thinking, and has never been brought up to date. It remains antiquated and bears very little relationship to the way we are governed. It is a myth that the referendums in 1899 and 1900 asked the “people” to approve the draft Constitution. The few selected “people” were asked if they wanted “union of the Colonies or disunion”. The acceptance of the original draft Constitution was taken for granted. The draft Constitution was never about democracy or Australian sovereignty. Another of the myths this book debunks is that the Constitution can only be changed by a referendum of the Australian people. The fifty colonial representatives; referred to as our “the founding fathers”, saw fit to include thirty nine provisions allowing Parliament to change the Constitution any time the ruling party wished. They have done this so many times in the last 114 years that no one has kept count. Read this book and find out why this primary law of the land is never taught in our schools, and how it controls your life.",['Graham L Paterson'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xhnbCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=xhnbCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=AUSTRALIA%27S+CONSTITUTION&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Strategic Book Publishing & Rights Agency,2015-04-03,http://books.google.com/books?id=xhnbCQAAQBAJ&dq=AUSTRALIA%27S+CONSTITUTION&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Political Science'],,B000L7AY0I,,AXF2V1WPI5USC,Jeff V.,97/109,3.0,1138665600,"Decent Source, but Don't Let This be Your Only Guide","This is certainly not a comprehensive or complete guide to classical CDs. While I've been using this guide for a number of years, I'm not finding it to be as useful or as helpful as it once was. In fact there was a time when I relied on this source exclusively, but I've found over the years that I missed out on several great recordings (not to mention composers) that were either overlooked in the book or were give less than 3 stars for whatever reason.What the editors of the Penguin Guide are attempting to do is to make primary recording recommendations for purchase within the classical repertoire. This is no small feat due to the long history of classical recordings resulting in the shear number of available recordings (even in this time of contraction and deletions by the major labels). However, keep in mind only 3 editors are making these recommendations, and as with any review source, the opinions are highly subjective and biases tend to creep in. The editors are British, and as such, there is a definite bias towards British labels, performers and conductors (Simon Rattle, Vernon Handley and John Eliot Gardner can do no wrong). Anyone using this book as a primary source should be aware of it. I've learned to work around this by weighing the editor's opinions according. Also, I use several other sources for reviews. There are many good sources available in print and online.Also, and I can't emphasize this enough, there are many, many great recordings overlooked by this guide. Yes, many of these are by American orchestras and labels (believe it or not, American orchestras are capable of performing British music), but there are also several independent labels and releases that get overlooked. Don't let this be your only source when looking for recordings. There are also many great performances that only get a two or two star rating. The list is too long to list here, but I've been amused by seeing two star ratings next to recordings that are certainly worth three stars. The editors also put a rosette next to recordings they believe to be of special merit. These are highly subjective picks, and I've found over the years that they should not necessarily be a primary recommendation - I've been disappointed with several.I believe the Penguin Guide to be most useful to the novice collector who is just beginning a collection. Most of the 3 star recordings are fairly solid recommendations (although don't pay particular attention to the order of the reviews - Simon Rattle's Beethoven Symphony cycle should not be the number one cycle to have in anyone's collection, there are too many more worthy cycles out there - at a cheaper price too).Also, one of the changes that have been made over the past few editions is the addition of DVDs. While I find the DVD reviews interesting, it is not a primary reason that I buy the book. This edition really puts the spotlight on DVD reviews. But what's most irritating is that the DVD reviews come before the CD reviews after each composer entry - often with twice as much space devoted to each DVD entry. I'd rather they spend more time reviewing additional CDs. The DVDs should be in a separate section or better yet, a separate guide.If you have the previous edition (2003/04), I wouldn't upgrade unless you want the most recent DVD reviews.",1
Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.,"“Csikszentmihalyi arrives at an insight that many of us can intuitively grasp, despite our insistent (and culturally supported) denial of this truth. That is, it is not what happens to us that determines our happiness, but the manner in which we make sense of that reality. . . . The manner in which Csikszentmihalyi integrates research on consciousness, personal psychology and spirituality is illuminating.” —Los Angeles Times Book Review The bestselling classic that holds the key to unlocking meaning, creativity, peak performance, and true happiness. Legendary psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's famous investigations of ""optimal experience"" have revealed that what makes an experience genuinely satisfying is a state of consciousness called flow. During flow, people typically experience deep enjoyment, creativity, and a total involvement with life. In this new edition of his groundbreaking classic work, Csikszentmihalyi (""the leading researcher into ‘flow states’"" —Newsweek) demonstrates the ways this positive state can be controlled, not just left to chance.

Although Carnegie's title is often the target of derision, it is a deceptively deep and important work. There's a very good reason why How to Win Friends... has been a bestseller for seventy years as the man shares essential truths with us about human behavior. Every single one of us can profit from his advice. His central ideas, such as that one should avoid arguments whenever possible, cannot be questioned. The command that one should listen to others and let them talk about themselves is crucial to being liked. A ""simple"" idea like that one is one that actually works.

The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1),"A gripping and prescient tale from New York Times best selling author Joel C. Rosenberg. ""... The Last Jihad absolutely crackles with high energy and a chilling premise--what if the war on terror goes nuclear."" -- Rush Limbaugh Jon Bennett is a top Wall Street strategist turned senior White House advisor. But nothing has prepared him for the terror that he will face. Saddam Hussein dispatches his top hit men to assassinate the President of the United States. Iraqi terrorists spread carnage throughout London, Paris, and Riyadh . . . and the Butcher of Baghdad has a nuclear ace in his hand that he has not yet played. Only a solid Arab-Isreali coalition against Iraq can keep the U.S.--and other Western nations--from certain devastation. And only Bennett and his beautiful partner, Erin McCoy, can make that happen. Their secret project--a billion-dollar oil deal off the coast of Gaza--could be the basis for an historic peace treaty and enormous wealth for every Isreali and Palestinian. But just before a treaty can be signed, Isreali commandos foil an Iraqi Scud missile launch, recovering a nuclear warhead and evidence that the next attack will level Washington, New York and Tel Aviv. Now, the Isreali Prime Minister gives the American President an ultimatum: Melt down Baghdad within one hour . . . or Israel will do it herself. From Jerusalem, Bennett and McCoy must summon all their stealth and savvy to save themselves--and the world--from absolute destruction.

Catch-22,"This fiftieth-anniversary edition commemorates Joseph Heller’s masterpiece with a new introduction; critical essays and reviews by Norman Mailer, Alfred Kazin, Anthony Burgess, and others; rare papers and photos; and much more. Nominated as one of America’s best-loved novels by PBS’s The Great American Read. Soon to be a Hulu limited series starring Christopher Abbott, George Clooney, Kyle Chandler, and Hugh Laurie. Fifty years after its original publication, Catch-22 remains a cornerstone of American literature and one of the funniest—and most celebrated—books of all time. In recent years it has been named to “best novels” lists by Time, Newsweek, the Modern Library, and the London Observer. Set in Italy during World War II, this is the story of the incomparable, malingering bombardier, Yossarian, a hero who is furious because thousands of people he has never met are trying to kill him. But his real problem is not the enemy—it is his own army, which keeps increasing the number of missions the men must fly to complete their service. Yet if Yossarian makes any attempt to excuse himself from the perilous missions he’s assigned, he’ll be in violation of Catch-22, a hilariously sinister bureaucratic rule: a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but if he makes a formal request to be removed from duty, he is proven sane and therefore ineligible to be relieved. This fiftieth-anniversary edition commemorates Joseph Heller’s masterpiece with a new introduction by Christopher Buckley; a wealth of critical essays and reviews by Norman Mailer, Alfred Kazin, Anthony Burgess, and others; rare papers and photos from Joseph Heller’s personal archive; and much more.

In its own way, the series is kind of exciting and it's pretty fun reading an interpretation of the Endtime. The writing isn't really good, but it's bassically unobtrusive. You never stop and get shocked at how badly it's written, although you also don't stop and marvel at how beautiful a particular sentence is constructed. Nothing in it to offend, although nothing in it to really provoke thought or reflection.All in all, it's pretty much an interesting light snack. My feeling though, is, why bother with that when there's so much more out there. Christ Clone Trilogy by Beausinger is a fresh take on the idea that's every bit as well written as Dune or any other science fiction series. Caldwell's We All Fall Down is another great novel, the best of the three in my opinion. It's certainly not a middle of the road novel. The language can be harsh, although it seemed entierly appropriate to the characters situation- when being strapped down and tortured, I would guess harsh language would escape the tongue-, the plot is sometimes brutal, although it should be considering that it's hell on earth, and the characters don't always make the right decisions, even when they're Christians. But I found all of that to be to its credit. Even when I disagreed with what was happening or being said, I was always engaged in the novel. I was never just watching the words pass as in Left Behind, but was always fully engaged with the characters and the plot. These are characters who are faced with horrible circumstances and have to make decisions. Sometimes they are wrong, sometimes not, and often it's hard to judge. But in reading that, you're forced to think, to reflect. No one really seemed to make any inner choices in Left Behind, so there wasn't much engagement. Certainly it didn't spur me into thinking or questioning my own relationship with God the way Caldwell's novel did.Left Behind isn't bad. But Christ Clone Trilogy and We All Fall Down are brilliant. Why settle for not bad when brilliant is out there?",1

Assault on the Liberty,"The definitive account of the infamous 1967 attack on the USS Liberty by Israeli forces and the continuing controversy over what really happened. • Notorious incident: In 1967, Israeli fighter jets and torpedo boats attacked the spy ship uSS Liberty in international waters during the Six-Day War. Thirty-four sailors were killed and more than 170 wounded, many critically injured. Israel claimed mistaken identity, which a U.S. naval court of inquiry confirmed, but that explanation is contradicted by the facts of the case. • Based on new revelations: James Scott has interviewed Liberty survivors, senior u.S. political and intelligence officials, and examined newly declassified documents in Israel and the united States to write this comprehensive, dramatic account. He reveals that officers in Israel’s chain of command were aware of the Liberty’s identity and shows how events in Vietnam prompted the American government to deemphasize the attack despite widespread disbelief of Israel’s story. • Journalist and son of an attack survivor: Scott’s father, John, was an officer and engineer aboard the Liberty who was awarded the Silver Star for helping to save the ship from sinking.",['James Scott'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=72cI13uPqGMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=72cI13uPqGMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Assault+on+the+Liberty&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Simon and Schuster,2009-06-02,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=72cI13uPqGMC&source=gbs_api,['History'],3.0,0972311602,25.0,A19RXUN5QN7OGD,William Hughes,97/105,5.0,1075075200,A Compelling Account of the Murderous Israeli Attack,"This is a compelling, documented and authoritative account, told by an eyewitness of the murderous Israeli attack, on June 8, 1967, on the USS Liberty.

Outlines of the black letter law (e.g. Gilberts) aren't as useful for something doctrinal like con law. You want clear exposition in prose. You want concise descriptions of all the important cases and what they stand for. You want Chemerinsky.All con law students should be grateful that one of the nation's leading Constitutional practitioners and professors has written this book. Its size is intimidating, but that's because it covers far more territory than the typical intro con law class. It's so well-done, though, that it's something serious students and lawyers will want on their bookshelves long after the first year -- as a supplement for advanced-topics classes, and as an essential reference work.The book is well-organized in an outline format with headings and subheads, so you can easily follow the thread of complex doctrine over time, like the Commerce Clause, or across its varied applications, like Equal Protection. Chapters are thorough but well divided. The organization allows you to find exactly what you need and to zero in on a particular narrow point or case, or to read more expansively about a doctrine's development, change, and varied application. Chemerinsky's prose is neutral, straightforward, always clear. He's analytical but doesn't make arguments. You couldn't say his writing has personality, but it is quite readable.This book is the con law supplement of choice at my school (Michigan). No one I know has regretted buying it.",1

They have launched a plot to raid the treasure hoard guarded by Smaug the Magnificent, a large and very dangerous dragon. Bilbo reluctantly joins their quest, unaware that on his journey to the Lonely Mountain he will encounter both a magic ring and a frightening creature known as Gollum. Written for J.R.R.

Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS,"When a 20-year old Waffen-SS veteran of two years' combat against the Soviets and Americans is confronted with the awful, undeniable truth of the Holocaust, he must reconcile it with his pride in his comrades' battlefield sacrifices. The author served in SS Mountain Infantry Regiment 11 Reinhard Heydrich, part of 6th SS Mountain Division Nord. The book is mostly an account of his extensive combat service against the Soviets in northern Karelia and Finland, with a shorter section describing combat against the Americans in the Vosges and in the Saar-Moselle triangle. Voss reflects on the totality of his wartime experiences, from the origins of his reasons for enlisting in the Waffen-SS to his experiences in US captivity. The result is a compelling and honest account.",['Johann Voss'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VsMhAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=VsMhAQAAIAAJ&q=Black+Edelweiss:+A+Memoir+of+Combat+and+Conscience+by+a+Soldier+of+the+Waffen-SS&dq=Black+Edelweiss:+A+Memoir+of+Combat+and+Conscience+by+a+Soldier+of+the+Waffen-SS&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Aegis Consulting Group,2002,http://books.google.com/books?id=VsMhAQAAIAAJ&dq=Black+Edelweiss:+A+Memoir+of+Combat+and+Conscience+by+a+Soldier+of+the+Waffen-SS&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],3.0,0966638980,13.43,A96VY2TCAHE4G,Mannie Liscum,97/104,5.0,1078963200,A memoir of rare value!,"Black Edelweiss is a rare example of a personal WWII memoir written soon after the events (most of the draft was written while the author was a POW during 1945-46) with the emotional and historical breadth of a book written from a much greater distance of time and utilizing a variety of non-personal references. Johann Voss (a pseudonym) has put his life in the SS-Mountain Infantry Regiment 11 (given the name &#65533;Reinhard Heydrich&#65533; in 1942) to paper in a way that the reader can truly assess the actions of a single soldier, his immediate platoon members and larger Regimental force rationally without the baggage of bias. This is not to say that the author has created a typical post-war apologetic piece that draws empathy/sympathy from the reader. Rather, Voss draws the reader along in an honest forthright story of his experiences as a loyal soldier within a larger group of comrades who, although fighting for the Hitler regime, did so with heart and passion for comrades, unit and country, but with clear chivalry (or at least as much as can fairly be expected in war) and battle fairness. It is the very nature of when this book was drafted (and little changed by the author later although published 60 odd years after being drafted) &#65533; while the author was still feeling connection to and pride of unit &#65533; that makes this NOT a typical Nazi apologia book. The book was however written at a time when the author was learning (second hand) about the atrocities of the Nazi regime and the SS structure more particularly, and as such the author is able to place his military experiences in perspective of the regime he served. This creates both an honest look at combat and the emotions invoked upon finding for what and whom he and friends served and died for. Emotion is raw and real in this book.Voss starts and ends the book in third person from the POW pen, but in between weaves an engrossing story of how a young impressionable German is compelled to join an elite SS-Mountain Regiment; how this decision positively affects his life; how he survives the cold and combat of service above the Artic circle, in the Vosges Mountains, and the last days of the western Reich frontier; and how his earlier decision to join this elite group of men affected his life upon realization that his combat unit has been wholesale lumped with the SS of the Endl&ouml;sung. The stories of regiment combat are visceral in content and quite rewarding. One can feel the cold, stress, fear and adrenalin of the situations.I highly recommend this book if you want a clear and apparently unembellished, time-unbiased picture of a German combat unit in action. If you want to double your pleasure read Black Edelweiss back-to-back with another Aberjona Press production, Seven Days in January by Wolf Zoepf. This latter book deals exclusively with the SS Nord Division and it&#65533;s combat both above the Artic Circle and the Lower Vosges and is pitched more from the pure combat history perspective.",1
The Genesis Debate: Three Views on the Days of Creation,"Are the Genesis creation days 24 hours long? Ages of time? Or a literary framework?

There will likely be a handful of people who don't believe in evolution, who will find themselves relegated to the party's margin. The Kansas State Board of Education discovered this very thing when they deleted macroevolution from the state's science education standards. They believed their decision to let local school boards decide whether or not to teach macroevolution was rather innocuous. Instead they found themselves alone at the party. Most people have strong beliefs regarding evolutionary theory, but in many cases these beliefs are based on feelings rather than on knowledge or study. With the exception of a high school biology class, few people know the details of evolutionary theory or keep up to date on the latest science. This same notion can be applied to people's knowledge of the book of Genesis, strong feelings, but little grasp of details or themes.Just as the evolution debate has heated up this past year so has the debate about the book of Genesis. The view that the days of creation were literal twenty-four hour days is prevalent amongst Evangelical Christians. So prevalent that many Evangelicals now equate this interpretation as orthodoxy. But this interpretation does indeed have competition. Creeping competition that challenges the traditional view of the creation account. The Genesis Debate takes on this topic, and presents three interpretations of Genesis's creation account.In The Genesis Debate six scholars present to us a written discourse of their disputed interpretations of Genesis's creation account. Specifically their debate centers on whether the &quot;days&quot; of creation were literal twenty-four days. The two scholars who champion the traditional Twenty-four Hour view are J. Ligon Duncan III and David W. Hall. Hugh Ross and Gleason L. Archer pitch the &quot;Day Age&quot; view. This view states that the each day of creation is an age of unspecified duration. They further believe that these ages dovetail perfectly with the latest scientific data. Lee Irons and Meredith G. Kline, present perhaps the most novel interpretation of Genesis. They call it the &quot;Framework&quot; view. The Framework view takes a non-literal interpretation of the creation account. The Genesis Debate is organized into three sections. Within each section one view is given an opportunity to present their case. Then the opposing views critique that view. Each section is concluded by a response to the critiques by the view presented in that section.The first view presented is the Twenty-four Hour view. Two distinguished scholars, J. Ligon Duncan III and David W. Hall, make the case for interpreting the days of creation as seven twenty-four hour time periods. Duncan and Hall's knowledge of church history and the Bible are formidable. They make it abundantly clear that throughout the history of Christianity, most church leaders have believed the days of creation to be literal twenty-four hour days. They support their view with a scriptural diatribe that falls somewhat short of the mark. They use heavy pedantic language that renders the simple complex. They could have bolstered their support by simplifying the ideas they use to support their view. They also fail to answer the question that nags modern readers. That question is, what would the church fathers do if they had access to the technology and scientific data that is now available? Would they consider a different interpretation of Genesis? By not dealing with this question, they leave some wiggle room for newer interpretations. These two bright men seem to make the mistake that the O.J. Simpson prosecutors did. They rely on a &quot;mountain&quot; of Biblical evidence, but fail to deal with a few specifics that are exploited by the competing views.The &quot;Day Age&quot; view goes second. Hugh Ross and Gleason L. Archer present a lucid, well-written account of their interpretation. The strength of their view lies in their ability to meld their interpretation of the Genesis creation account with scientific data. Their argument centers on the Hebrew word used for day, which they say can be used to represent a long period of time as well as twenty-four hour day. By interpreting the creation days as periods of unspecified lengths of time, the Day Age view can reconcile Genesis with science. But, Ross and Gleason's case is thin when is comes to finding church fathers who agree with them. They have quotes of church fathers that support their point of view but Duncan and Hall dispute these quotes, which make it difficult for the lay reader to know which side is correct.The last view presented is the &quot;Framework&quot; view. Lee Irons and Meredith G. Kline do an excellent job of presenting their view, which is not easily done. The Framework view takes a non-literal and non-sequential interpretation of the creation account. That is, they don't believe that each day of creation is a literal twenty-four hour day. They also assert that the creation events mentioned on Day One do not necessarily occur before those of the following days. That is, these events are not listed in sequence. The Framework view is attractive because it allows one to bring out the poetry of the creation account. In fact they assert that the significance of the creation account is theological. The Framework view, however, is perhaps at some point too broad. So broad that the non-disciplined interpreter could take a non-literal interpretation in a direction that the Framework adherents themselves would not approve of.The Genesis Debate is perhaps the only place one will find a civil discourse between Christians who believe the days of creation were literal twenty-four hour days and those who hold different views. The Genesis Debate is a worthwhile read for many people because it may be the only place they will hear a view different than the Twenty-four hour view. The layman, however, must be warned. The writers are from academia and many of their arguments are technical and filled with terms unfamiliar to the average reader. Some of the prose drags. Yet it is worthwhile reading because it will acquaint the reader with the current state of a debate that is important to Christians. One cannot divine with any degree of certainty which view will enjoy widespread acceptance. But one can be certain that the debate on Genesis will continue.",1
Works of love;: Some Christian reflections in the form of discourses,,['Søren Kierkegaard'],,http://books.google.com/books?id=-GjdtgEACAAJ&dq=Works+of+love%3B:+Some+Christian+reflections+in+the+form+of+discourses&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,1946,http://books.google.com/books?id=-GjdtgEACAAJ&dq=Works+of+love%3B:+Some+Christian+reflections+in+the+form+of+discourses&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Spiritual life'],,B0007E4NVG,,AHTC40HQKBTJM,Ross James Browne,97/104,5.0,1045440000,One of his best works,"_Works of Love_ by Kierkegaard is the most uplifting, encouraging, and hope-restoring book I have ever read. Kierkegaard's statement that ""the greatest act of love anyone can ever achieve is to mourn for someone who is dead"" is a statement I have used to guide myself through innumerable existential crises and has given me hope in my darkest hours. The wisdom contained in this book is an essential tool in dealing with the premature and untimely death of a loved one, and restoring your hope and faith in God even in the face of tragedy. Kierkegaard's sense of empathy and morality is unsurpassed by any other philosopher living or dead, and I will also go so far as to call him a saint.This book is also extremely well-written, well-translated, and readable. _Works of Love_ is living proof of the theory that inherently complicated and profound subject matter does not necessarily have to be extremely difficult to read. Kierkegaard's use of anecdotal situations and clear real-life examples to illustrate his theories make the book more readily understandable, and his writing style naturally lends itself to clear and accurate translation. Unlike many German philosophers of the same time period, Kierkegaard (from Denmark) does not lapse into highly personal, abstract, and inaccessable concepts, but instead focuses on more realistic and timeless problems that have plagued humanity since the dawn of sentience. While authors like Hegel and Schopenhauer are intellectually stimulating and mildly interesting, reading their works does not exactly make you happier, more hopeful, and more empathetically caring. You are often left with nothing but pie-in-the-sky theories regarding esoteric philosophical questions that are only marginally relevant to the everyday realities we experience. Kierkegaard, on the other hand, can greatly improve the quality of your life, and help you achieve a positive and non-hateful outlook.Also keep in mind that this is easily Kierkegaard's most personal book, revealing the inner nature of his own spiritual beliefs. Unlike an author like Heidegger, who will ramble for 400 pages and never even bother to tell you if he believes in God or not, Kierkegaard is up front and honest with the reader, speaking directly to us. A true expert on Kierkegaard knows that he often wrote under pseudonyms, and playfully stepped into another character or alter-ego, lending an almost ficticious aspect to some of his philosophical works. In reading some of these pseudonymous books, a careful reader will observe that Kierkegaard often contradicts his real persona in subtle ways. It is easy to overlook his purposeful self-contradictions and alter-ego characterizations unless you compare these works with his more personal and truthful works, _Works of Love_ being the prime example.Should you buy this book? YES!! I unconditionally recommend this book to anyone, anywhere. It is the perfect introduction to Kierkegaard; the one you should read first. It is also a recapitulation and summary of all of his most important concepts, so it could also be read last. But at some point you must read this book. The only type of person who would not appreciate this book is someone who has thoroughly convinced himself of the hopelessness, meaninglessness, and absurdity of existence; someone who has become completely disillusioned with God in response to tragedy, and believes knowledge can only beget sorrow. Most people with this kind of negative outlook are often anti-intellectuals anyway, and seldom read legitimate philosophical books anymore. But even if you are disillusioned with God and unable to comprehend tragedy, you still might want to read this book because it may provide the only way out of your depressing predicament. _Works of Love_ is a shining beacon of hope in an often violent, tragic, and chaotic universe, and is one of the few books ever written that is sophisticated and credible enough to pull even the most die-hard sceptic out of the despair of hopelessness.",1

Then two years ago I came across it (in English) in a used book store here in Southern California, read it and adored it. It's one of the few books I have read more than once.I love the movie as well, bought it on video about a year ago and have watched it many times. Yes, Redford is not a Dennis F.Hatton type but he's perfect. (In '86 I thought he was utterly miscast, despite being already then a huge Redford fan!)Thurman took seven years to write this bio, and even learned Danish in the process. She truly cares about her subject and thankfully takes her time. Dinesen comes fully alive in this book, a rare accomplishment for biographers.If you go to Copenhagen, take the train north along the coast (20 min. from the Central Station), get off at the beautiful, small, old Rungsted Station and walk down to Rungstedlund (about a mile). It was there that Karen Dinesen, later Blixen, was born and raised. She returned in 1931 from her farm in Africa, and began writing her first collection of tales, Seven Gothic Tales, published in 1934 in English and in Danish (in her own translation) a year later. She ""only"" wrote seven books for the next thirty years, but oh, what books. It is indeed quality, not quantity that counts with art.In 1991 Blixen's house was opened as lovely museum with a small tasteful book store with books by and about Blixen (she is always referred to as Karen Blixen in Denmark), and a very nice and quiet small cafe. Upstairs is a wonderful exibit about her life, including seperate rooms with many books from her private collection.The rest of the museum consists of her beautiful living rooms and study which all look as if she were still living there.Behind the house is a parklike garden which is open 24 hours a day all year round. Here are the flower beds from where she gathered the cut flowers for her beautiful arrangements, the meadows with cows and sheep, wood benches placed along the paths, and the enormous tree under which she was buried in 1962. It is a magical garden, which she herself made sure would be preserved so that the public may enjoy as she once did.Thurman's biography and the film ""Out of Africa"" generated so much interest in Blixen that it became possible to fund the museum, thus enabling us to travel back in time and walk with Karen Blixen in her garden and her house 40 years later. After you read the biography, you'll want to book your ticket to Copenhagen!A bit of bragging: My parents live a mile from Rungstedlund, and I return to Blixens home every time I visit Denmark on my vacations. Rungsted anno 2002 is one of the most sought after addresses in the Copenhagen area, and it is easy to see why: Right on the coast, with meadows and woods still unharmed by suburban development, the scenery makes me sigh with longing just writing of it!Note: The museum has a web site.Plenty IS rotten in the State of Denmark, but Rungstedlund is pure bliss, and represents everything that is good and beautiful about Denmark.",1

Surprisingly, a search on Amazon.com did not return very many books on the topic. Like any good college educated liberal I chose the one book which garnered praise from all my favorite trusted sources such as the New York Times and the Washington Post. I didn't see how I could possibly go wrong spending $12.92 for the 800 page book ""Secrets from the Temple: How the Federal Reserve Runs the Country"", which The Nation said, ""May be the most important political book of the decade.""Unfortunately, after reading William Greider's 10 year, day by day account of Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volker's back and forth decisions on raising and lowering interest rates, I still did not have the foggiest clue as to what money is or how it is created. I'm sure most people would have given up at this point but I was not ready to throw in the towel. For some reason I was not convinced by the book's conclusion that it was critically important to maintain the money mystery because ""Taboos uncoded lost their power to persuade...The mystery was necessary, therefore, to sustain social faith. Knowledge was disturbing. Not knowing the secrets was reassuring.""I needed another book, however the only ones that the New York Times seemed to recommend were all described as condensed versions of ""Secrets of the Temple."" I had no choice but to bite the bullet and for the first time in my life order a book which was not recommended by the New York Times. I ordered ""The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve by G. Edward Griffin. At least Willie Nelson seemed to like it. Actually, I wasn't quite sure if Willie Nelson was wholeheartedly endorsing the book in his review which simply read, ""Scary. It's the story of the world banking system. Enough said.""I was quite pleased that Jekyll Island contained a pretty good description of the money creation process. However, the book contained a lot more than that. All I can say is that I often see my life as divided into two main periods; before reading Jekyll Island and after reading Jekyll Island. I finally knew what Willie Nelson meant by ""scary.""Now that I was starting to really get somewhere in figuring out how money is created, I needed to find more information to clear up some of the details. My wife even got involved in the search for truly academic and scholarly information. I will be forever indebted to her for discovering a free downloadable copy of a book entitled ""The Mystery of Banking"" by Murray Rothbard. This was exactly what I had always been looking for. It clearly explained the process without dumbing it down in any way or obfuscating the details in order to ""sustain social faith.""That is essentially how I got started in learning about money. I have found this to be the most fascinating field I have ever encountered and I am very glad that I didn't take William Grieder's advise to remain blissfully ignorant.",0

"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham. Riddell memorial lectures)","The Abolition of Man is a 1943 book by C. S. Lewis. It is subtitled ""Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools,"" and uses that as a starting point for a defense of objective value and natural law, and a warning of the consequences of doing away with or ""debunking"" those things. It defends science as something worth pursuing but criticizes using it to debunk values-the value of science itself being among them-or defining it to exclude such values. The book was first delivered as a series of three evening lectures at King's College, Newcastle, part of the University of Durham, as the Riddell Memorial Lectures on February 24-26, 1943","['C S Lewis', 'C.

Carpenter,97/104,5.0,996969600,Contra the fundamentalist rousaswgnr &amp; the Vancouver leftist,"The Abolition of Man is a stunningly brilliant masterpiece, prophetic in its insight. Several of the other reviewers here who gave the book is plainly deserved five stars have done a fine job of reviewing its contents. Let me respond briefly to the fundamentalist (rousaswgnr) in Campsville, CA and the leftist bigot in Vancouver, WA. Both fail to scratch the surface of the book for opposite reasons.The reviewer in Campsville (rousaswgnr) apparently thinks that any appeal to right and wrong that doesn't simply quote Bible verses is anti-Christian. Obviously, he would be completely incapable of trying to convince nonChristians that there are universal moral laws that are contravened at our peril -- the very thing Lewis was trying to do. At one point this seeming &quot;fundamentalist&quot; wrote that only scripture teaches right and wrong and things about God. That statement is ironically contrary to scripture itself which says &quot;the heavens declare the glory of God&quot; and that God has revealled His ways and parts of His nature in nature itself and in human consciences (Romans 1). The reviewer rousaswgnr contradicts scripture while trying to defend it. That's a pity. For if he really understood scripture or C. S. Lewis he would know that Lewis is saying what scripture says: God has universal moral laws that He has written into nature that all people can see and that have been generally recognized by major civilizations throughout the ages. Lewis also says it with breath-taking beauty.The leftist from Vancouver, WA is even more vacuous than the fundamentalist. (That's typical.) Like the typical leftist, he imagines that he's brilliant while proving that he doesn't have a clue. He thinks he's clever by quoting Lau Tzu on the meaning of &quot;Tao.&quot; But if he'd bothered to have really read Lewis or found out the meaning of the Chinese word &quot;Tao&quot;, he would know that Lewis was not referring to Taoism but to the much more pervasive use of the idea of &quot;Tao&quot; in Chinese culture: that offered by Confucianism. The humanist from Vancouver, WA condemns Lewis for not getting it because he assumes that anyone who disagrees with his leftist ideology is empty-headed. His mindless repitition of Marxist ideology -- that moral systems are the mere fronts for political powers -- shows he's the one who hasn't understood Lewis. The Vancouver, WA leftist's statement that Lewis is merely defending &quot;western&quot; morals is absurd to the point of questioning whether he actually read the book -- or whether he's capable of really reading anything that isn't pre-committed to his Marxist politics. Indeed, the Vancouver leftist demonstrates that he's one of those men without chests about whom Lewis is writing while the fundamentalist from Campsville shows why modern conservative Christianity -- so frigthened of innovative communication -- has been so impotent, even though it holds the solution to the cultural problem Lewis diagnoses if only it could get over its reactionary anti-intellectualism and rigidity of mind that the reviewer exemplifies.",1

Certainly there are many comic situations and laughable characters, but Powell's (pronounced POE-UHL, not POW-UHL) comedy is intended less to make uslaugh than to make ussmile. I know many novels that are far funnier than this one, and if that were the book's only virtue, it would not enjoy the status that it does.Above all, this is a work that limns in almost tedious detail the interrelations and interworkings of a segment of English society in the 20th century. These first three books take you from the early twenties into the early thirties. Despite the series great length, there is nothing epic about the scale of the novels except for the overall length of of the series as a whole. The scenes are all horribly mundane. A party here, a dinner there, a chance meeting in a bar, more parties, more dinners. But as the parties and dinners multiply, and as one social encounter builds upon another, the series does indeed take on an epic quality.This new edition is far more attractive than the old mass market edition of the series, but I do wish that someone would have taken the effort to supply an appendix (perhaps to the final volume) that would (as in some editions of Trollope and Proust) explain who all the characters are and to whom they are related. By the sixth volume in the series, I began to find it extremely difficult to remember precisely where each character fit in the social world as a whole.The greatest virtues of Powell's series are his richly delineated characters (of which there are at least fifty to a hundred who are to some degree significant) and his marvelously elegant prose. I believe that anyone who loves novels would love this series, in particular those who have enjoyed Proust.",1

In 49 B.C., the seven hundred fifth year since the founding of Rome, Julius Caesar crossed a small border river called the Rubicon and plunged Rome into cataclysmic civil war. Tom Holland’s enthralling account tells the story of Caesar’s generation, witness to the twilight of the Republic and its bloody transformation into an empire. From Cicero, Spartacus, and Brutus, to Cleopatra, Virgil, and Augustus, here are some of the most legendary figures in history brought thrillingly to life. Combining verve and freshness with scrupulous scholarship, Rubicon is not only an engrossing history of this pivotal era but a uniquely resonant portrait of a great civilization in all its extremes of self-sacrifice and rivalry, decadence and catastrophe, intrigue, war, and world-shaking ambition.",['Tom Holland'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=B_VdAlX0XNwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=B_VdAlX0XNwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Rubicon:+The+Last+Years+of+the+Roman+Republic&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Anchor,2007-12-18,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=B_VdAlX0XNwC&source=gbs_api,['History'],34.0,1400078970,11.53,A14B2NR2XELLQ0,Omer Belsky,97/103,4.0,1087344000,The Decline and Fall of the Roman Republic,"It is easier to pin point the ending of Tom Holland's book then its beginning - it ends with the death of Augustus in 14 AD, years after the Roman Republic has ceased to exist in anything but its name.The beginning of Holland's book, like the beginning of the end of the Roman Republic, is harder to spot. Does it start with the fall of Carthage? With the murder of reformer tribunes Tiberius Gracchus and Gaius Gracchus? Or with the first clashes between Marius and Sulla? Holland tells it all, in a spellbinding narrative that is hard to put down.In just under four hundred pages, we get a short overview of the early republic, and then a focused narrative its final century. This is the story of some of history's greatest men and women, from Sulla to Cato, Pompey and Cicero and Cleopatra, and of course, Julius Caesar. It is a tale of murders and political maneuvering, honor and greed and lust. And, complicated as it all is, Holland serves as a fine guide through the intricate web of the dying republic.I think it's the power of the prose, above anything, that makes Holland's book so fascinating. It reads like a novel, probably the best written account of the Roman World I've read since Robert Graves's I, Claudius. At times, he may use anachronistic terms for the narrative ('location, location, location', or 'Mutually Assured Destruction') - but that's a misdemeanor that is easily forgivable, and some may find it charming.In the blow by blow account of the political struggles, it is sometimes hard to see a larger scheme or thesis. In as far as there is one, it is probably that the decline of the Roman Republic came through the rise of the Roman Empire. As the Romans expanded, out of Italy and into the entire Hellenistic world and beyond, its generals became increasingly rich and powerful. The armies they have raised stopped being faithful to the Republic, and shifted their loyalties to their leaders. The republic became an arena for a small number of powerful men, reducing the rest of the aristocracy to the role of near-spectators, when the best they could do was pick sides.In the introduction, Holland says that most events in the History are amenable to different interpretation, but in the text itself, there are precious few references to such instances. Holland, I think, generalizes much too much about the way 'Romans' in abstract thought, felt, or acted. His footnotes, referring exclusively to ancient sources (although his bibliography does contain much modern work) is virtually useless for anyone unless they're willing to dig into the primary sources.But at the end, that's just not that kind of a book. Holland weaves a breathtaking tapestry of characters, events, and touches of mysticism. Any flaws in the historiography are overshadowed by the triumph of storytelling.",1

However, from what I have read and tried, my feelings are mixed. First of all, I'm a graduate from the bottom of the class of a &quot;Top 10&quot; law school. I could not get into any firm, thus I don't have the problem of having to explain not receiving an offer after my summer (I'm interested in gov't at this point).Grades/school: this book is great for people who are currently enrolled and doing fairly ok-to-well in law school, and want an extra boost to get into a better firm/employer. Students at the very top and very bottom of the class are unlikely to benefit from the book. Why? Because most firms only look at grades, then school, nothing else. Almost all big firms, the ones most capable of hiring graduates, won't hire below the top 75% of a top law school. Kimm suggests avoiding firms that are concerned about grades. Well, unfortunately, that would be almost all of the firms except the ones that pay $28K a year.Small firms: the author suggests looking at small firms. The problem is these firms also tend to be fixated on grades, sometimes even more so than large firms. In addition, small firms tend to be very low paying ($40K and below) and you will be required to work the same long hours as at a big firm. Grant it, you will have your foot in the door. On the other hand, small firms don't hire until you admitted to the bar, so you're looking at a few months without an income, or longer if you don't pass the bar the first time.Volunteering: the book suggests doing this at various gov't agencies like DA's or City Attorney's offices. Watch out: most of these places will use the free help and not offer a job. They DO hire volunteers in boom times, but then everyone hires in a boom time so there would be no point in volunteering in the first place. You have to be at the right place at the right time. The experience you will get from volunteering is limited, on the other hand if you are unsure about what you want to do (i.e., corporate vs. litigation), it can be helpful.Networking: Kimm suggests ways to network. I actually tried her suggestions, and found that I was meeting partners from large grade-heavy firms who could never hire me if they wanted to, OR, solo practicioners. This makes sense, because these are the people who need to make appearances at public events the most. I never really ran into that associate/partner at an up and coming small or mid-sized firm that was recruiting heavily. Although we are in a recession, many firms are doing well. Maybe I'm just looking in the wrong places. However, it seems that more and more firms have set procedures for hiring and are not willing to be schmoozed as easily as in the past.Mass mailings: her opinion of mass mailings have been confirmed by many attorneys who received my resume. However, I did receive 3 interviews that way. Moreover, if one does not do a mass mailing, how is one supposed to contact employers? Afterall, it is a numbers game. To her credit, I think Kimm talks about well-tailored emails to alum at law firms. This works well, but again, if the firm has a grade-floor, there is no way around it generally.In conclusion, while many of Kimm's suggestions would be fruitful for that student in the top 55% of a top 25 school wanting to work in NYC, it is not right for everyone.",1

"Computer Organization and Design, Third Edition: The Hardware/Software Interface, Third Edition (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Computer Architecture and Design)","This best selling text on computer organization has been thoroughly updated to reflect the newest technologies. Examples highlight the latest processor designs, benchmarking standards, languages and tools. As with previous editions, a MIPs processor is the core used to present the fundamentals of hardware technologies at work in a computer system. The book presents an entire MIPS instruction set—instruction by instruction—the fundamentals of assembly language, computer arithmetic, pipelining, memory hierarchies and I/O. A new aspect of the third edition is the explicit connection between program performance and CPU performance. The authors show how hardware and software components--such as the specific algorithm, programming language, compiler, ISA and processor implementation--impact program performance. Throughout the book a new feature focusing on program performance describes how to search for bottlenecks and improve performance in various parts of the system. The book digs deeper into the hardware/software interface, presenting a complete view of the function of the programming language and compiler--crucial for understanding computer organization.

Lessnau,97/102,4.0,1111104000,"Very Informative, But Has Many Editing Problems","This is a tough book to review. On one hand, it's got an amazing amount of information in it. On the other, it's got a lot of editing problems. It also suffers from a lack of focus on who its audience is. So, splitting the difference, I'm rating this book at 4 stars out of 5.Regarding the book's audience, it's vital that you pay attention to the chart on page xiii of the Preface. It maps your path through the book based on whether you're a software-type or a hardware-type. Assuming I was so brilliant that I could ignore such trivia, I attempted to plow my way through the whole book. Software-type that I am, I had some tough times in a couple of sections and then utterly failed to understand anything when I hit the core of Chapter 5. If I had paid attention to that chart, I would have known to skip that part of the book. However, even for the material that's within the path laid out for you by that chart, a lot of the work seems to assume knowledge on the part of the reader. For instance:- Chapter 2 is about the MIPS assembly language. In the exercises, you're supposed to write various code snippets. Many of these snippets assume far more familiarity with writing entire assembly programs than is presented.- The exercises at the end of each chapter are broken into three types: regular, ""For More Practice,"" and ""In More Depth."" Those last two types require far more knowledge than is presented. It looks like the authors culled them from previous editions and, instead of trashing them, just stuck them on the CD and referenced them.- Exercise 3.9 is annotated as requiring Section 3.2. But, unless you're very familiar with the implementation of MIPS assembly language, there's no way that someone using the material in that section alone could do the problem.- Exercise 3.13 is annotated as requiring Section 3.3. Yet, the question is completely undoable unless you've at least read Appendix B. Of course, Appendix B, itself, is practically indecipherable unless you've had previous experience/knowledge with Logic Design.- Exercises 7.21, 7.22 and 7.38 talk about ""the first 1 million references in a trace of gcc."" The book contains no definition of what that means. Those questions also mention the cache simulator ""dinero"" and say, ""see the Preface of this book for information on how to obtain them."" There's no such information in the Preface or on the CD. The CD does have MipsIt software which includes a cache simulator, but it doesn't seem to work reliably on my XP SP2 system (it also doesn't seem to accept those ""traces"" as input). That could be operator error, though. Doing a Google search pointed me to max.stanford.edu as a source of the software and traces. But, it seems you have to have a Linux system (or be smarter than me) to use them.- Exercise 7.35 gives a C code snippet and asks you to calculate the expected cache miss rate. There's nothing in the book about calculating expected miss rates from algorithms. Also, the exercise is assigned partially against section 7.4. Section 7.4 covers virtual memory, not caches.- Most of the Chapter 8 exercises are mis-referenced (i.e., they're labeled as being associated with certain sections of the chapter which have nothing to do with the question). Along with the standard problem of assuming knowledge that's not covered in the book, many of them teach new information instead of testing/re-enforcing comprehension of the provided material.There are many incorrect page number and section number references in the book. This is especially bad in the exercises where it becomes impossible to do certain ones since the code and data they're referencing isn't findable (at least easily). This problem does seem to get better as you get to the later chapters. There are also problems with basic typography. Some examples:- Exercise 3.29 wants the reader to come up with a non-restoring division algorithm based on the restoring division algorithm in Figure 3.11 on page 185. The figure and page numbers are right, but the text of the question refers to ""step 3b"" and ""restoring the Remainder"" that aren't present there. So, there's no way to figure out what the authors are doing or what they want the reader to do in the exercise.- Many of the tables and diagrams in the book use ""color"" to help indicate something important. Unfortunately, the color used is dark blue. Unless you look very carefully, there's no difference between the regular text/line color (black) and the ""emphasized"" version.- The text description of Figure 7.31 on page 544 mentions labeled sections that show differences in performance based on cache associativity. The labels are missing.- Exercise 7.45 gives you a C snippet that you're supposed to document. It contains ""!!"" as an operator. C has no such operator. My guess is it's either a logical AND, ""&&"", or a logical OR, ""||"".Also, the chapters are WAY too long and there are no exercises following the sections. For instance, Chapter 2 is 100 pages long over 20 sections. All the exercises (59 of them) are clumped together in the back of the chapter. The authors note the necessary section numbers with these exercises, but each section needs its own set of exercises immediately following it. This would also alleviate the problem where the authors have the wrong section numbers assigned to exercises. If these exercises were at the end of a section instead of clumped with 60 other exercises at the back of the chapter, they'd stand out more if they didn't belong.And, finally, the book needs answers to the questions.As an aside, this book is used in Florida State University's (FSU) CDA 3101: Computer Organization course.",0

Laclos' story of evil and depravity, starring a pair of jaded aristocrats so satanic we wonder if they have a human bone in their bodies, is one of the greatest, if not the greatest, novels of the 18th century. In a nutshell, it revolves around the cynical plot to seduce and destroy the reputation of a young girl fresh out of her convent, which they plan and achieve with the icy calm and cynical detachment of a pair of mathematicians solving a calculus problem.The anti-hero and anti-heroine of this book, the Vicomte de Valmont and the Marquis de Merteuil, fascinate and repel us at once by their sheer wickedness. Valmont is a depraved Casanova, lay-em-and-leave-em, who has lost count of all the broken hearts and destroyed characters he has left in his wake. The Marquise de Merteuil, married and widowed too young, has combined shrewd intelligence with appalling powers of deception to engage a string of lovers whom she uses and casts off at random. Somehow these two find each other and form an unholy partnership. When the book opens, their affair is already spent, but they have remained friends; and the Marquise is infuriated when she learns she is about to be dumped by her current lover, a rich aristocrat named Gercourt, who is about to marry Cecile de Volanges, the most naive teenager who ever emerged from the protective cocoon of convent education. Her main attraction, for him, is her virginity, and it is this the Marquise wants Valmont to do away with so that Gercourt will find out on his wedding night that he didn't get the innocent virgin he was expecting, but an already corrupted young woman, and will become the laughing stock of Paris.Seducing and abandoning an innocent girl is an old story to Valmont, but he has more pressing concerns; he is hopelessly in love with a young married woman, Madame de Tourvel, whose virtue seems impregnable. And here he appears as more sympathetic and human than the Marquise; even if he's trying to seduce a married woman, he, at least, is capable of love; something which is beyond the Marquise, who sees other people as nothing more or less than objects to be used or cast aside. It's only when he finds out that Cecile's mother has been telling Madame de Tourvel his scandalous life history that he decides to seduce Cecile, to pay back the mother for messing in his business. At the same time, he perseveres in his pursuit of Madame de Tourvel. But just at the point of victory, the Marquise turns his very strength, his ability to love, into a weakness; she uses it as a weapon against him to make him think his love for Madame de Tourvel is contempible. At this point, we see the real conflict in the book, Valmont against the Marquise. But Valmont, as cynical and jaded as he is, is no match for this lady; her very emotional detachment makes her unassailable. Valmont doesn't have a chance. He's not only destroyed the Madame de Tourvel, he's also destroyed himself. It looks like the Marquise is the sole victor in this combat. But is she? Fatally, the Marquise has forgotten that letters can be dangerous weapons, and she's written a few too many. What goes around comes around.Laclos's book caused a sensation in its own time that reverberated for decades afterward; 40 years after its publication it was condemned by a criminal court and publicly incinerated in a mass book-burning ceremony. If Laclos had still been alive then, they might have wanted to toss him on top of the pyre. Whatever feelings the book may have aroused when it was written, it has endured for two hundred years since as a masterpiece of literature in any language. Any book that has been the basis of three different films, each unique from the other, has to be saying something to modern readers. Laclos' book says a great deal and says it magnificently.",0

In today's day and age there are more choices than ever of what we consume into our systems. Some foods are deceiving choices.

While not a complete treaty on the subjects (not a single book can address the 12,000 pages US tax code, associated case law, financial planing, accounting, liability protection, etc.); it presents in a nutshell, key questions that the business owner should ask his/her advisors. Its language is easy to understand and the examples easy to follow. The grouping of themes by discipline helps to understand better the subjects on an individual basis. Unfortunately, that also makes the book, as a whole, appear a little bit confusing.Overall, the book is insightful and instructive. The only weakness I found was its strong bias toward C corporations. After following up on the subject of different type of corporations, I found out why. But I still believe that the book should have included a more detailed explanation of the differences between C , S and LLC corporations on the subject of deductions, specially regarding the owners. They are substantial; and with most advisors recommending their clients to go with S or LLC corporations (probably because of the way they are taxed), this lack of better comparison could make the book appear as misleading or worse, plain wrong. Nevertheless, Kudos to C.W. Allen and his team for a bold talk on the scary subject of paying the least amount of taxes possible.",1

Stranger in a Strange Land,"The original uncut edition of STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND by Hugo Award winner Robert A Heinlein - one of the most beloved, celebrated science-fiction novels of all time. Epic, ambitious and entertaining, STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND caused controversy and uproar when it was first published and is still topical and challenging today. Twenty-five years ago, the first manned mission to Mars was lost, and all hands presumed dead. But someone survived... Born on the doomed spaceship and raised by the Martians who saved his life, Valentine Michael Smith has never seen a human being until the day a second expedition to Mars discovers him. Upon his return to Earth, a young nurse named Jill Boardman sneaks into Smith's hospital room and shares a glass of water with him, a simple act for her but a sacred ritual on Mars.

I won't go into details (you can find them easily on the net) but essentially the cut down version is not written in Heinlein's ""voice"" but drastically cut down (by RAH) to fit into a length the publisher thought proper.And so it does not sound like any other Heinlein novel, and this has split the ""Stranger"" camp right down the middle. There are those to whom the original book was bible -- and those tend not to like other Heinlein works. Those of us who love Heinlein have always felt kind of ""meh"" about Stranger... until the uncut version was released (in 1991).Now, the Kindle version being sold is the cut version, so if you were a fan of that (published in 1961) you'll love this version. However, if you are not a huge fan of that version I would stay away from this Kindle version at all costs (there are easily found web versions of the uncut novel -- I'm not advocating piracy, but it's unlikely we'll ever see a Kindle uncut version as Amazon seems clueless here -- even official reviewers seem to think this version is uncut, but I can promise you it isn't, as the passages are clear and easy to find in even the sample version).One last thing -- if you have read the cut version (either this Kindle version or otherwise) you might want to give the uncut version a try.

The fact is, for the most part it's not s.o.c. at all. (See the Chicago Manual of Style, 10.45-10.47 and note the example they give...Joyce knew how to write s.o.c.). A better word for A Portrait is impressionistic. Joyce is more concerned with giving the reader an impression of Stephen's experience than with emptying the contents of his head. What's confusing is the style mirrors the way Stephen interprets his experiences at the time, according to the level of his mental development.When Stephen is a baby, you get only what comes in through the five senses. When he is a young boy, you get the experience refracted through a prism of many things: his illness (for those who've read Ulysses, here is the beginning of Stephen's hydrophobia - ""How cold and slimy the water had been! A fellow had once seen a big rat jump into the scum.""), his poor eyesight, the radically mixed signals he's been given about religion and politics (the Christmas meal), his unfair punishment, and maybe most important of all, his father's unusual expressions (growing up with phrases like, ""There's more cunning in one of those warts on his bald head than in a pack of jack foxes"" how could this kid become anything but a writer?)It is crucial to understand that Stephen's experiences are being given a certain inflection in this way when you come to the middle of the book and the sermon. You have to remember that Stephen has been far from a good Catholic boy. Among other things, he's been visting the brothels! The sermon hits him with a special intensity, so much so that it changes his life forever. Before it he's completely absorbed in the physical: food, sex, etc. After it he becomes just as absorbed in the spiritual/aesthetic world. It's the sermon that really puts him on the track to becoming an artist. One reviewer called the sermon overwrought. Well, of course it's overwrought. That's the whole point. Read it with your sense of humor turned on and keep in mind that you're getting the sermon the way you get everything else in the book: through Stephen.After Stephen decides he doesn't want to be a priest, the idea of becoming an artist really starts to take hold. And when he sees the girl on the beach, his life is set for good. That scene has to be one of the most beautiful in all of literature. After that, Stephen develops his theory of esthetics with the help of Aristotle and Aquinas and we find ourselves moving from one conversation to another not unlike in Plato (each conversation with the appropriate inflection of college boy pomposity). In the end, Stephen asks his ""father"" to support him as he goes into the real world to create something. I like to think that this is an echo of the very first line in the book. The father, in one of many senses, is the moocow story. The story gave birth to Stephen's imagination and now it's the son's turn to create.This is such a rich and beautiful book. I suppose it's possible for people to ""get it"" and still not like it, but I really think if you read and re-read, and maybe do a little research, the book will open up to you the way it did to me.",0
Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel,,,,,,,,,,1400131995,72.99,AK81WLVD5KGUX,"John S. Ryan ""Scott Ryan""",97/102,5.0,1131926400,Better than a Micky Nozawa experia flick,"I'd been waiting for quite a while to read this third entry in Richard K. Morgan's series of Takeshi Kovacs novels. It was worth the wait, and in some respects it may be the best of the series so far. Tak travels through some dark, dark territory here.Don't be fooled (or put off) by the pace. Where _Altered Carbon_ was a rapid series of body blows, _Woken Furies_ is more like being dragged down very slowly by a very large weight. There's a lot going on here, but quite a bit of it is in the background and between the lines. If you don't get into Tak's head pretty early on, the novel may read like a travelogue.Not that that's necessarily _bad_. Probably a lot of us were curious about Harlan's World, and we get to see quite a bit of it here. We also finally get to put faces (the faces of their current sleeves, anyway) with some familiar names from Tak's past. All of that will probably be interesting enough to entertain the casual reader.But if that's all you get out of this novel, then you're missing the meat of it.The surface-level plot opens with Tak on Harlan's World in a synthetic sleeve, trying to get back into his own body. He's also, as we gradually discover, on some sort of mission, the details of which we don't really learn until some 250 pages in. And not too far into the tale, we meet someone who just _might_ turn out to be Quellcrist Falconer . . . or maybe not. Furthermore, Tak is being pursued by a younger version of himself, decanted from a backup copy he didn't know existed. Things build toward a final revelation with implications far, far beyond Quellism and the local politics of Harlan's World.The pace, though, is generally slow. Oh, things do happen (and people start dying horribly within the first twenty-odd pages), but a lot of the action is off-screen. We spend the bulk of the novel the way we spent most of _Star Trek: The Motion Picture_: Going Somewhere.The really interesting stuff, and the real, behind-the-narrative content of the novel, is what happens to Tak. I'm not going to give you any more clues about this; I'm just going to warn you to listen with both ears as those titular furies awaken and the possibilities of redemption come and go. There's a lot of internal turmoil going on here, and Tak isn't necessarily going to tell you about it directly. Hell, despite his Envoy training, I'm not sure he's even fully aware of all of it himself.Readers who keep wanting recycled versions of _Altered Carbon_ will continue to be disappointed, as they were with _Broken Angels_; Morgan clearly isn't going to keep rewriting the same book for us. Now, me, I think that's a good thing.",1

THE BUREAU AND THE MOLE has a good photo section but no index or bibliography, both essential in my opinion. Half of it is a bio of Louis Freeh, who should hang his head in shame rather than be credited for uncovering Hanssen. The sex revelations are here, but unless you like pornography I advise you to skip the part about Hanssen's postings on the internet. Still, the information about Bonnie Hanssen's brother--an FBI agent--who suspected him and was ignored is almost worth the price of the book. Four stars.2. THE SPY NEXT DOOR has an index but no photos and no bibliography. The writing is a little wooden and there are little mistakes like getting the the church where the Hanssen's were married wrong. They have some sex stuff too, but thankfully no internet ramblings. A workmanlike job that reads like a Time magazine cover story. Three stars.3. THE SPY WHO STAYED OUT IN THE COLD has photos, a bibliography and an index. It's also about 30 pages longer than the other two. Alas, no sex though the chapter on the stripper runs for some 12 pages and is titillating. It's the most complete with it's biggest scoop being that Hanssen told friends he wanted to be a double agent long before he joined the FBI and thus should have never been hired. Four-and-a-half stars.",1

Está harta de batir mantequilla, de quitar las malas hierbas del jardín y de que la pretendan jóvenes granjeros sin gracia.

Sin embargo, bajo las torres góticas de Dragonwyck, sus jardines en flor y las granjas de los arrendatarios se esconden terribles secretos: la riqueza de los que tienen mucho y la miseria de los que no tienen nada, la lucha entre la libertad y las costumbres feudales, y el amor, la violencia y la oscuridad que a veces se esconden tras una apariencia bien distinta. Nota: Dragonwyckfue publicado por primera vez en 1944 y su éxito fue tal que fue llevado al cine en 1946, con Gene Tierney en el papel de Miranda y Vincent Price en el de Nicholas.

It focuses on a young Connecticut woman, Miranda Wells, who sees a change in her station in life through a chance invitation by a wealthy distant cousin. Handsome, gallant, and a renaissance man in terms of his interests, Nicholas Van Ryn invites his young cousin to visit and stay at his lavish home in upstate Hudson, New York and act as a companion for his young daughter.When she meets him for the first time, Miranda is smitten, as Nicholas is the embodiment of all her romantic yearnings. Moreover, her stay at his luxurious, palatial home on the Hudson River, a mansion with the fanciful name of Dragonwyck, is an answer to her prayers and a chance to escape the hard work and tedium that has been her lot on her family's Connecticut farm. Dragonwyck, however, has its share of secrets and a miasma of evil that lurks in its halls and grand rooms.The only thorn in Miranda's side is her cousin's wife, Johanna, who does not care for having a younger, more attractive woman, bustling about the house and preening before her husband. Johanna finds ways to make her feelings understood by Miranda, but Miranda, reckless in her admiration for her cousin Nicholas and relatively naive, is somewhat obtuse. Moreover, there is a pre-existing undercurrent of tension between husband and wife in the Dragonwyck household of which Miranda is seemingly oblivious.Miranda's presence exacerbates the tension in the household that, ultimately, ends in tragedy for all concerned. It is that tragedy that will, for Miranda, mark the beginning of a life journey that will provide some painful and unsettling lessons. It is a journey that will ensure a measure of painful self-discovery and remove the rose colored glasses through which she had viewed her world.The book is well researched and redolent with information about the Dutch influence in New York and its aristocracy. It details many of the issues and traditions that were germane to the period and is richly descriptive of a way of life in New York, both downstate and upstate, that has since gone by the wayside. It intertwines a number of historical events and personages with the lives of those characters who are at the heart of this wonderful and vastly entertaining book. It is a book that will keep the reader turning the pages until the very last.",1
"LAST COYOTE (HARRY BOSCH, NO 4)","Harry attacked his commanding officer and is suspended indefinitely, pending a psychiatric evaluation. At first he resists the LAPD shrink, but finally recognizes that something is troubling him and has for a long time. In 1961, when Harry was twelve, his mother, a prostitute, was brutally murdered, and no one has ever been accused of the crime. With the spare time a suspension brings, Harry opens up the thirty-year-old file on the case and is irresistibly drawn into a past he has always avoided. It's clear that the case was fumbled and the smell of a cover-up is unmistakable. Someone powerful was able to divert justice and Harry vows to uncover the truth.

This is helped by the fact that he is suspended for pushing a superior through a plate glass window and sent to a police shrink. While he is on forced leave, he decides to resolve these problems, of course, against all company policy. But his view is &quot;Everybody counts or nobody counts.&quot; As he unravels the mystery, it seems to him that the murder of his mother didn't count because she was just a woman of the streets. Both this theme and the theme of a reappearing coyote (lost, hungry and bewildered) occur again and again in this gripping, forceful novel. The coyote and Bosch are drawn together - like to like - and it seems to Bosch that both he and the coyote are a vanishing breed. I defy you to put Connelly's book down for more than a few hours, if at all.He is a master of twists, surprises and impeccable logic that carry you to the end in a whirlwind of pleasure and excitement.This one has a finish that is amazing and shocking.It's content will stay with you a lone time, perhaps forever,as you contemplate this world and those who live in it everyday. I maintain the best way to read Bosch is from the beginning with THE BLACK ICE - and follow in sequence. Michael Connelly has now won three awards for his novels.

Dragonwyck,"El libro de Anya Seton que inspiró la obra maestra del cine de Joseph L. Mankiewicz. La historia de una mujer notable y el misterio y el suspense que la esperan en los magníficos pasillos de Dragonwyck. Miranda Wells tiene dieciocho años y es la hija de un granjero en la América profunda. Está harta de batir mantequilla, de quitar las malas hierbas del jardín y de que la pretendan jóvenes granjeros sin gracia. Por eso, al recibir la invitación de un pariente lejano en Nueva York, Nicholas Van Ryn, para que se mude a su casa, se entusiasma y lucha por convencer a su madre y, sobre todo, a su padre, para que le permitan ir. La oportunidad de vivir en Dragonwyck, una gran mansión, el magnetismo que el misterioso Nicholas ejerce sobre ella y su modo de vida le parecen un sueño. Sin embargo, bajo las torres góticas de Dragonwyck, sus jardines en flor y las granjas de los arrendatarios se esconden terribles secretos: la riqueza de los que tienen mucho y la miseria de los que no tienen nada, la lucha entre la libertad y las costumbres feudales, y el amor, la violencia y la oscuridad que a veces se esconden tras una apariencia bien distinta. Nota: Dragonwyckfue publicado por primera vez en 1944 y su éxito fue tal que fue llevado al cine en 1946, con Gene Tierney en el papel de Miranda y Vincent Price en el de Nicholas. Es una historia que, como pocas, muestra cómo se hunde el orden feudal en el Nuevo Mundo y cómo sale a la luz uno nuevo, con el coste que ello conlleva.",['Anya Seton'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mMiCDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=mMiCDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Dragonwyck&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Libros de Seda,2019-01-08,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mMiCDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],,B0006AQGFC,,A1L43KWWR05PCS,Lawyeraau,97/101,5.0,1056844800,A HOUSE IS NOT A HOME...,"This is a beautifully written work of historical fiction, set in 1840s New York. It focuses on a young Connecticut woman, Miranda Wells, who sees a change in her station in life through a chance invitation by a wealthy distant cousin. Handsome, gallant, and a renaissance man in terms of his interests, Nicholas Van Ryn invites his young cousin to visit and stay at his lavish home in upstate Hudson, New York and act as a companion for his young daughter.When she meets him for the first time, Miranda is smitten, as Nicholas is the embodiment of all her romantic yearnings. Moreover, her stay at his luxurious, palatial home on the Hudson River, a mansion with the fanciful name of Dragonwyck, is an answer to her prayers and a chance to escape the hard work and tedium that has been her lot on her family's Connecticut farm. Dragonwyck, however, has its share of secrets and a miasma of evil that lurks in its halls and grand rooms.The only thorn in Miranda's side is her cousin's wife, Johanna, who does not care for having a younger, more attractive woman, bustling about the house and preening before her husband. Johanna finds ways to make her feelings understood by Miranda, but Miranda, reckless in her admiration for her cousin Nicholas and relatively naive, is somewhat obtuse. Moreover, there is a pre-existing undercurrent of tension between husband and wife in the Dragonwyck household of which Miranda is seemingly oblivious.Miranda's presence exacerbates the tension in the household that, ultimately, ends in tragedy for all concerned. It is that tragedy that will, for Miranda, mark the beginning of a life journey that will provide some painful and unsettling lessons. It is a journey that will ensure a measure of painful self-discovery and remove the rose colored glasses through which she had viewed her world.The book is well researched and redolent with information about the Dutch influence in New York and its aristocracy. It details many of the issues and traditions that were germane to the period and is richly descriptive of a way of life in New York, both downstate and upstate, that has since gone by the wayside. It intertwines a number of historical events and personages with the lives of those characters who are at the heart of this wonderful and vastly entertaining book. It is a book that will keep the reader turning the pages until the very last.",1
The Plausibility of Life: Resolving Darwin's Dilemma,"Two eminent biologists tackle and provide exhilarating new answers to what they argue is the central, unresolved question of evolution","['Marc Kirschner', 'John Gerhart']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2HDxzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=2HDxzQEACAAJ&dq=The+Plausibility+of+Life:+Resolving+Darwin%27s+Dilemma&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,2005,http://books.google.com/books?id=2HDxzQEACAAJ&dq=The+Plausibility+of+Life:+Resolving+Darwin%27s+Dilemma&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Science'],,0300108656,,ARG3N345EVKYV,Carl Flygare,97/101,5.0,1161820800,Darwin's Dilemma Resolved - Faciliated Variation and Evolutionary Novelty,"Creationist luddites repeatedly claim that life's diversity and complexity could never arise from the progressive accumulation of random genetic change - they conveniently forget non-random selection. Also dismissed are the unimaginably vast stretches of geologic time available for the constant interplay of variation and selection to shape phylogeny. They also question how genetic changes coordinate to realize new types of organisms.In ""The Plausibility of Life: Resolving Darwin's Dilemma"" Kirschner and Gerhart propose 'facilitated variation' as an evolutionary mechanism to resolve these and other issues. Recent advances in cellular and developmental biology have shed new light on how evolutionary biology generates novelty (new features). Although natural selection is well understood, variation as a component of evolutionary theory has been less well developed.Darwinian orthodoxy aggregates a large number of successive mutations, each usefully selected for the survival of the organism, to produce novel structures such as wings or eyes. Facilitated variation posits that physiologically adaptable 'core processes' (conserved by evolution across vast periods of time and groups of organisms) - along with properties such as weak linkage and exploratory processes - enable proteins, cells, and body structures to interact in numerous ways to create novelty from a limited number of genes and mutations. Life has evolved an evolutionary architecture (or toolbox) that promotes novelty and complexity - and minimizes deleterious outcomes.Several hundred core processes generate the morphology, physiology, and behavior of an organism during development. Some have remained unchanged for hundreds of millions or even billions of years. Even though they are strongly conserved their behavior can be altered by signals that are often quite simple. A process may only have two states - on or off - and signals switch it from one state to the other. The presence or absence of these signals, and their timing, can produce large changes in the organism's phenotype.The concept of 'weak regulatory linkage' plays a vital role by allowing reconfigurability and providing a degree of instability - essential ingredients that promote the key biological advantage of flexibility. Weak regulatory linkage is also important to evolution because it plays a large part in the repertoire of core processes. Genes don't need to provide detailed instructions on how an organism should develop - they only have to modify the way in which conserved core processes function during development. Several detailed examples are provided to show how this works - ranging from the placement of microtubules in eukaryotic cells to the distribution of whiskers and their central connections on mice. The role of Hox and other selector genes in embryology are also discussed.This important book convincingly answers critics who claim that Darwinian evolution is unable to explain novelty and complexity. Facilitated variation is supported by the latest science. Unfortunately this book will not be widely read by non-specialists. The difficulty level is significantly above the popular science mainstream and careful attention from the reader is required - but the journey is well worth the effort. By closing the major gap in Darwin's theory Kirschner and Gerhart provide a timely scientific rebuttal to the schizophrenic post-modern medievalists who shill illusory 'irreducible complexity' or peddle vacuous 'explanatory filters' in a sterile attempt to hype the natural theology makeover known as 'intelligent design.'Other books you might enjoy includeGenesis: The Scientific Quest for Life's Originsby Robert M.

This is an excellent source of information-- packed with interesting recipes, some of which purport to be (and sound as if they might be) from the pioneers. It certainly provides a wide selection of dishes and goodies to make using long-term storage foods such as whole grains, dried milk, dehydrated fruits and vegetables, etc. There are, however, enough recipes that don't use these foods to justify purchasing the book to add to your cookbook collection, even if you don't store dried foods. Okay, so it's poorly edited. There are asterisks that don't seem to refer to anything, numerous spelling and grammatical errors, and apparent omissions. But these don't render the book unusable. The reader will need to work around them. The author appears to assume that the reader can already cook. It certainly isn't a book for the novice in the kitchen! I'd recommend that the reader carefully read any recipe before trying it, considering whether it makes sense or whether there might be some omissions. In addition to the very interesting recipes, the book has useful information on emergency substitutions, reconstituting dried foods, quantities to store, and survival foods (what's out there in the wild that you can eat in a pinch). All in all, I'd say it's a great addition to your cookbook library, very reasonably priced, an interesting read, and a must-have if you're into long-term food storage--definitely worth the investment!",1

Her books are easy to read &amp; well organized for both beginner &amp; advanced students.Because her work is read in different countries all over the world, there are 1-2 measurement units that require conversion to US standards. But these are simple elementary conversions. However the bulk of her recipes are in standard formats any wiccan would find in any other book. The oils, teas, &amp; bath products recipes are given in drops, tsp, &amp; tbsp (standard). The dry insence, potpourri, &amp; herb recipes are given in parts (standard).The only &quot;tricky&quot; measurements are in the food recipes. Since some but not all of her readers are American, she gives recipes in standard units that are familiar to most countries. (All Europeans, Austrailians, &amp; Americans are familiar with pints.) If you prefer your measures in cups, then just remember back to 5th grade math: 1 (british)pint=2.5cups (1 US pint=2cups). And if you look right there on your measuring cup, you will probably have measurements for ounces listed right along side the cup measurements since 8oz=1cup. Or you can simply remember: 1 oz=2 tbspThis is not rocket science, folks, so don't be scared off by customer reviews complaining about having to do simple conversions. Many times, Ms. West supplies conversions for you, such as a Harvest Moonshine recipe with calls for &quot;8 pints (20 cups) water&quot;. Really, the pints measurements are the only &quot;confusing&quot; aspect, (if you are so inclined to be confused).ALL US recipes use cups, tbsp, tsp, drops, pinches, pounds, ounces, &amp; parts......and so does Ms. West.

MacDonald's &quot;A Time For Trumpets&quot;, yet this, too, is an excellent and inspiring cover of the events leading up to and including the Battle of the Bulge. This book follows in the vein of detailing at the unit level what the war was like for the man on the ground, and incorporates a lot of first person testimony a la Stephen Ambrose.Thus, the reader is treated to a very thorough look at what the moment-to-moment experience was like from a number of the men who were there to fight it. As Col. Eisenhower was also a career military man following in his famous father's footsteps, he speaks with obvious authority and knowledge about the multitude of factors leading to the engagement on both sides, and one gains an appreciation for his expertise if not for his somewhat pedantic and limited writing skills. Still, the book is an interesting and accessible reading experience.Of course, since I had already read a number of other titles covering the same ground, much of the material was repetitive, but my impression after finishing it was that &quot;The Bitter Woods&quot; is a very authoritative single volume on the campaign, and that it competes favorably with all the others, although I should not want to so limit myself to a single such source for this, one of the finest moments in American war history. It is stirring to read about the first hand experiences of the tired, overextended, and under armed units of the American forces as they first engage the overwhelming German juggernaut. Beaten to a pulp, they regroup, and surrounded, outnumbered, outgunned, and outmaneuvered, in a desperate hand to hand combat, fight back with hellish ferocity and beat the German forces back.This account puts to the lie the idea that the only reason we won the war was superior number and endless logistics. Deprived of those two advantages during the extremely bad weather during the worst part of the battle, the U.S. Army simply outfought their German attackers. I personally would recommend you read this book hand in hand with the Toland book (&quot;Battle&quot;), for together they provide a really complete and quite varied look at all of the aspects of one of the most tenaciously fought battles on the western front of the European theater of the Second World War.

The authors cover most aspects of plant care, from basic watering and lighting to reproduction and pest control to extensive entries on houseplant varieties. Every plant entry seems unique, breaking from the dull template of information that the more encyclopedia-like plant books have. This engaging style is a strength of the book, but it is also a weakness because the style lends itself to inconsistency. For example, the entry on Saintpaulias (African Violets) specifies the height at which artificial lights should be placed above the plants, but many of the other entries do not give such information. Another complaint is that the secondary plant list in the back does not feature a photograph of every plant. For the price I paid, I would have willingly give up a few of the extra photos in the front if it would result in a more comprehensive photo collection in the back. Identifying p! lants without pictures is very difficult. Nonetheless, no plant book is perfect, and this one comes very close.

The 900 Days: The Siege of Leningrad,"The Nazi siege of Leningrad from 1941 to 1943, during which time the city was cut off from the rest of the world, was one of the most gruesome episodes of World War II. In scale, the tragedy of Leningrad dwarfs even the Warsaw ghetto or Hiroshima. Nearly three million people endured it; just under half of them died, starving or freezing to death, most in the six months from October 1941 to April 1942 when the temperature often stayed at 30 degrees below zero. For twenty-five years the distinguished journalist and historian Harrison Salisbury has assembled material for this story. He has interviewed survivors, sifted through the Russian archives, and drawn on his vast experience as a correspondent in the Soviet Union. What he has discovered and imparted in The 900 Days is an epic narrative of villainy and survival, in which the city had as much to fear from Stalin as from Hitler. He concludes his story with the culminating disaster of the Leningrad Affair, a plot hatched by Stalin three years after the war had ended. Almost every official who had been instrumental in the city's survival was implicated, convicted, and executed. Harrison Salisbury has told this overwhelming story boldly, unforgettably, and definitively.",['Harrison Salisbury'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VQ1KDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=VQ1KDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+900+Days:+The+Siege+of+Leningrad&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Hachette UK,2009-04-29,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VQ1KDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],,B000O1BCAM,,ALR35EFI69S5R,"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman""",97/100,5.0,1023667200,The Classic Tome On The Seige Of Leningrad,"Few events in the annals of modern history compare to the saga of the terrifying siege of Leningrad for almost three years by the German Wehrmacht during World War Two. In this classic historical work, ""The 900 Days"" written by long-time New York Times correspondent and editor Harrison Salisbury, the incredible toll in terms of blood, sweat and tears of the millions of Russian protagonists trapped by the Nazis in the city is told. The story is told in such a graphic and moving fashion that the individuals involved are portrayed from a common sense, human perspective, in terms of describing breathing, struggling individuals locked into a living nightmare, each of them having to make a titanic effort day after day just to endure the hardships and survive.The scale of the siege itself boggles the mind; some three million residents and soldiers were encircled and entrapped at the beginning of the Nazi incursion into Russia in Operation Barbarossa, intensifying with a ruthless German offensive in early October of 1941 that literally strangled the lifeline for food and critical supplies from the embattled urban area. Of those trapped, almost half succumbed, and most of these fatalities were in a relatively brief period of time, commencing with the events of October 1941 and climaxing in early April of 1942. People starved, froze, drowned, were run over by tanks, walked into mine fields, succumbed to a wide range of diseases, were murdered by German soldiers, and sometimes were caught in artillery fire. In all, almost one and one half million people were lost during the siege.Yet in the midst of all this immense suffering and the degraded conditions that forced many to the brink of extinction, the people of Leningrad consistently fought back, fighting environmental conditions, temperatures that dipped below 30 degrees below zero, with no heat, no light, little or no food or water. Yet the fighting on the front went on, supported by the inhabitants, who did everything from digging ditches to helping to care for the wounded in the midst of their own daily struggles to survive. In this instance, they didn't merely endure; in fact they prevailed against incredible odds. In the final analysis, it was the German army that was destroyed.The scope of this achievement seems to be little appreciated today. And while Salisbury traces the causes in the tragedy of Leningrad in Stalin's sectarian governmental policies that ultimately played into Hitler's plans for capturing the city, he also describes the incredible contributions of a cross-section of the citizenry of the city, including artists, factory workers, soldiers, teachers, housewives, children, writers, and others engaged in the common daily struggle to survive without ever ceding the ground or the war to the foe. Even more impressive is his unflinching attention to detail, and his retelling of the final coup-de-grace delivered by Stalin, jealous and politically fearful of the genuine heroes made by the siege, who then arranged to charge, convict and execute all the principals of the city's campaign against the Germans based on trumped up charges of treason. This was one of the first books to deal with the levels of Soviet suffering and contribution to the war effort, and it has been praised quite consistently by readers and critics alike. I can recommend this book without reservation.Enjoy!",1

Even individual estates are placed on maps, when convenient.Seamlessly, from one map to another you can trace any route, find any name, and look into the neighboring area.The map by map directory provides further insight into the sources of information, variant ancient names and modern place names (if any),Obviously there's no such a thing as a telescope/microscope. You have to know what you are looking for, because details can sometimes shield the big picture. You need to know the original spelling of a name, or some variant. This book is invaluable when looking for names and places that are nowhere else printed in a map, at least a map that covers an area that places them in context.Now, what else could be useful?Basically, I would have liked three things:- an 'inverse' gazetteer or 'name dictionary'. Look for modern place names and find ancient equivalents.To look for a modern name is difficult. The book is not intended for this. You have to use the search engine in Acrobat, which means that you have to be using a computer. And scroll though the results. There is no straightforward way. So, a 'Modern Names Gazetteer' with ancient equivalents is something I'd like to have. Could a database fulfill this purpose? PDF formats do not allow data management, but the editor must have the data. Someone will provide this.- a different altitude color-coded scaleAs for the altitude color-coded tints, to my taste, there is at least a brown shade too many. The tinted scale is such, that some maps look a little brownish, because everything above 1000 feet has that background color. Of course, there are contour lines, but you have to look at them and read the numbers. Coding is not very useful in such a situation. Printed names over brown background are not easily readable.- a heavy paper o plastic loose-leaf with the Map KeyThe Map Key appears only on map 1, on the reverse side of the page, a good idea since the maps are not clogged with repetitive information and space is used for the essential purpose. But then you have to return to it for a reference. Thence, either it will wear out or hopefully you will remember usual references. Not for the casual reader. I've already photocopied it.Overall, an outstanding achievement. Four stars, could have been five if some of the above items had been included.",1

Kilian brings no new research and an unimpressive bunch of case studies. But by making the case once again for caring about Web text, Kilian's book serves a useful purpose.Many pages of the book are taken up with advice applicable to writing for any medium: understand your reader's viewpoint, use the &quot;active voice&quot;, avoid relying on your spell checker. Devotees of that classic writers' how-to manual, Strunk and White's The Elements of Style, will find a startling amount of familiar material. So will devotees of Web usability expert Jakob Nielsen and his Alertbox site. A substantial slice of Kilian's book could well have been gathered off a handful of well-known Web sites.But Kilian also makes a series of points that have been missed or underemphasised in discussions of Web writing to date:* The Web demands your writing deliver &quot;joltage&quot;. A former chief executive of the Fairfax newspaper group liked to compare the newspaper-reading experience to a warm bath. Web reading, by comparison, is a 30-second shower - get in, get the job done, wake you up, don't hang around. As Kilian puts it: &quot;Computers condition us for high joltage. A 'jolt' is an emotional reward that follows a prescribed action ... We feel deprived if we don't get some sort of jolt at regular intervals, so we go where we hope to find more stimulation which, on the Web, means web sites.&quot;* Beware old-style marketers who see the Web as another opportunity to pump a message at a commercial audience. In most media, the marketer hunts the customer down and delivers a broadcast or printed spiel that can be hard to avoid. On the Web, the customer comes looking for the transaction, with a million other sites a single mouse-click away. Research shows Web users are uncommonly likely to bolt at the sight of an old-style marketing pitch. A very few good Web marketers, on the other hand, already understand that the message of a commercial Web site must rely on a more subtle link with a brand's values.* The Web suits &quot;response&quot; writing which prompts the user to carry out an activity. In the offline commercial world an entire marketing discipline - direct response copywriting - has evolved to offer users spcific benefits if they carry out particular actions. Indeed, the long-established rules of direct response advertising copywriting often look remarkably like Web writers need to import these direct response lessons, in just the same way that Web interface designers need to understand how to convince users to click on the appropriate screen buttons. &quot;The Web is a culture of impatience,&quot; writes Kilian. &quot;Effective appeals offer quick and painlesss ways to respond&quot;.Killian could and should have given his readers more insights on issues like these, rather than recycling better-known guidelines. His book does not deserve whole-hearted recommendation. But it's nice to see Web writing getting some of the attention it deserves.",1

Ann Coulter is often abrasive, and even obnoxious in her prose and interviews. Point taken. Also, this book is being knocked a star for basically being a rehash of her columns over the last few years. I would have liked that to be a bit more openly advertised on the book itself, as unlike the other book I read by her this one is really not new material.Now for the book itself and its actual content. I think that normally pointing out that the review is of the books content is an absurd redundancy; however most of the reviews here are simply opinions about Ann and her views, not the book. So, let's look at the book. It is quite funny. Several sections on airline security measures after 9-11 had me laughing so hard I couldn't breathe. Make no mistake; her writing is excellent and very funny.On several subjects her points are quite disturbing. For example, her views on speaking with liberals and ensuring they are angry are deeper than they appear: ""People don't get angry when lies are told about them; they get angry when the truth is told about them"". (Page 10) Her point being that it is the truth gets the most rage as a reaction. Her insights on the liberal reaction to war today and how it varies to previous wars, such as Bosnia, are interesting in that they expose a double standard which is obvious. (Page 62) Her column on how the John Kerry plan is to appeal to the French is so funny it is hard to read (Page 64).Her exposure of the Democrat candidates' attempts at trying to appear knowledgeable and respectful of religious beliefs needs to be read. Whether it is Dean lying about his beliefs, or Kerry espousing his religious beliefs while defying everything his beliefs stand for, the pitiful attempts of liberals trying to appear as if they respect those of faith is hilarious and obvious to everyone except liberals. (Page 104) When it comes to union support, a long term strategy of Democrats, it appears that this too is but another tool of these people as the Teamsters overwhelming support the ANWR oil exploration but were abandoned by the Dems when actual jobs are at stake. (Page 138)Her most scathing comments are reserved for the tabloid level biased reporting of the New York Times. There are dozens of columns that outline with fully developed documentation that the Times is often well beyond merely liberal talking points and may in fact try to literally use outright falsehoods to create public perception. For example, the columns on the unconscionable support for the Central Park rapists and gang like attacks are best described as ""pure evil"" (my words) and Ann points out the obvious falsehoods used to support these animals. (Page 224). When the Times finally understood that the Clinton's may not be the innocent victims they claim to be, due to their stealing of furniture from the White House, marked how off the Times staff has been. (Page 245). That they fully supported a journalist who literally made his stories is just too easy to comment on.Overall, this is a very funny book. It will obviously be perceived differently by those on the opposite ends of the political spectrum, but say what you will about Ann, she is never dull. Well done.As a follow up read several years later, I stand by this review despite the criticism of it. The book is quite funny and well written, and whether you agree or not with her, that is what the review is based on.",1

Northwest passage,,['Kenneth Roberts'],,http://books.google.com/books?id=jy7EvgEACAAJ&dq=Northwest+passage&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,1939,http://books.google.com/books?id=jy7EvgEACAAJ&dq=Northwest+passage&hl=&source=gbs_api,,,B0008AC262,,,,96/99,4.0,1018742400,One novel- 2 very different books!,"Kenneth Roberts was one of America's finest writers of historical fiction- mainly because he actually really knew the history into which he placed his fictional characters.""Northwest Passage"" is arguably his most popular work, and its Book I was made into a pretty good 1940 movie with Robert Young as the fictional Langdon Towne and Spencer Tracy as the legendary Robert Rogers. (I must admit that everytime I read Rogers' dialogue in ""Northwest Passage"" I hear the voice of Spencer Tracy.) Anyway ""Northwest Passage,"" the novel, is actually made up of two very different books.Book I is one of the finest pieces of historical fiction that I have ever read. It's the story of Rogers' Rangers attack on the Abenaki Indian village of St. Francis during the French and Indian War. The story revolves around a fictional character, Langdon Towne, an upper middle class lad who wants to become a great artist by painting ""true life"" subjects such as Indians. Fleeing a dispute with local crooked politicians, Towne joins Major Rogers and his Rangers on the eve of their departure for St. Francis. What happens next is a thrilling story. Roberts' descriptions of the northern New England terrain, the agony of fatigue and starvation, and the gruesome depiction of the barbaric nature of war are stunning to read. Also amazing is the depiction of Major Rogers as seen through the worshipful eyes of Towne. The reader will finish Book I with a heroic image of Rogers as an indefatigable, courageous, clever tactician and born leader.Book II, though, is a disappointment. Of course, it is very understandable that Book II is a let down, since Book I can hardly be topped as a historical adventure. Roberts' spends most of Book II tearing down the heroic image of Rogers that he built-up in Book I. Alcohol, debt, political enemies, a bad marriage, and his own vices reduce Rogers to a rather pathetic character. Book II also suffers from a lack of focus- we follow Towne as he develops into a famous painter from New England, to England, to the Upper Great Lakes, to Canada, back to England, and then to New England. Unlike Book I, which dealt with just a few short months of time, Book II is all over the place. However, the biggest problem with Book II is that nothing really happens in it- just Rogers' long decline and Towne's search for fulfillment.Finally, Kenneth Roberts' books usually contain some extremely well developed and strong female characters, but ""Northwest Passage"" is lacking in this department. The interesting character of Jennie Coit disappears quickly. And Anne Potter, who had the possibility to be extremely interesting, is just too thinly drawn.""Northwest Passage's"" Book I is a terrific piece of historical fiction. I cannot speak more highly of it. However, Book II drags, and is really only interesting in that illustrates what happens to the characters introduced in Book I. Book II is actually just a very long and detailed epilogue to Book I.",1
"War in a Time of Peace: Bush, Clinton, and the Generals","Pulitzer Prize­-winning journalist David Halberstam chronicles Washington politics and foreign policy in post­ Cold War America. Evoking the internal conflicts, unchecked egos, and power struggles within the White House, the State Department, and the military, Halberstam shows how the decisions of men who served in the Vietnam War, and those who did not, have shaped America's role in global events. He provides fascinating portraits of those in power—Clinton, Bush, Reagan, Kissinger, James Baker, Dick Cheney, Madeleine Albright, and others—to reveal a stunning view of modern political America.",['David Halberstam'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EPDPCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=EPDPCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=War+in+a+Time+of+Peace:+Bush,+Clinton,+and+the+Generals&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Simon and Schuster,2015-11-17,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EPDPCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],1.0,B00005QTHF,,A23SB6VGGB9E8U,"Craig L. Howe ""The Pointed Pundit""",96/99,5.0,1002758400,Ghosts of Vietnam Haunt 1990s American Foreign Policy,"I had a professor who defined journalism as ""history written in a hurry."" In his sequel to The Best And The Brightest author David Halberstam uses the journalist's tools - personal interviews and background research - to explore how the shadow of Vietnam and the Cold War shaped the United States' foreign policy during the 1990s.What emerges, is a thoughtful, portrait of the United States from the perspective of its foreign policy decisions. It is a book written for thoughtful citizens; a book that, clearly, was not written in a hurry; a book that unearths the struggles, egos and the political maneuvering among the key figures in The White House, the State Department and the military. Halberstam shows how the decisions of Vietnam War Veterans, like Colin Powell and Anthony Lake, and those who were not, like President William Clinton, influenced American politics and policy.Lesser-known players who contributed to the picture were not overlooked. Halberstam notes that the irony of the Gulf War was the wrong branch of the service and the wrong military leaders were celebrated at its conclusion. Norman Schwarzkopf and Colin Powell received ovations for their humiliation of an allegedly mighty, but now bedraggled Iraqi Army.If one man was responsible, he notes, it was an innovative air force strategist, Colonel John Warden. At the time of the Gulf War, Warden was the head of a top-secret air force group working within The Pentagon and represented a group of younger military officers who were eager to adapt military thinking and planning to the uses of the new technological advanced weaponry.The major opposition to his thinking came not from the army or even civilians, but rather senior officers in his service branch, especially three and four star generals attached to the Tactical Air Command. They believed the airpower was there to support the army on the ground. They despised Warden and his ideas. As luck would have it, when General Schwarzkopf requested an air plan for Desert Storm, Warden's senior officer was on leave and the request found its way to his desk.Roy Gutman, an American reporter who happened to be in Yugoslavia in 1991 and was starting to write what would be a series of prophetic dispatches for Newsday, the Long Island, New York daily, is another unknown player. Stationed in Belgrade from 1973 to 1975 as a Reuter's correspondent, he had embraced what he termed as ""the golden age of Tito"", a Serbo-centrism that tempered the vision of many western diplomats and journalists.On his return in 1991 he saw signs that Yugoslavia was becoming a different country. An interview with Vojislav Seselj, an ultra nationalist Serb who had once been jailed by Tito for his ethnic views and was known for his personal cruelty, convinced the journalist that something sinister was about to happen with its likely epicenter as Banja Luka, a city in Northern Bosnia, which time which prove to be the home of the Serbian campaign of ethnic cleansing.Halberstam's search for the real story behind the headlines gives the reader clear insights into why events in the Balkans, Haiti and Somalia reflect American foreign policy and politics. He discusses the wariness of the U. S. military to ever be caught again in a ground war lacing clear objectives, the frustrations of political leaders who never served in the military and their effects on American commanders in Kosovo.On the last page of the book, the author allows himself a glimpse into our future, which in light of the events of September 11, 2001 proves tragically prescient. Writing in May, 2001, Halberstam, allows himself to speculate about the need for a missile shield, what he terms ""a high-tech Maginot Line, the wrong idea at the wrong time."" He notes that intelligence analysts believe ""the threat to an open society like America c[o]mes from terrorists, rather than the military power of rogue states"" which themselves present an exceptional target.The author has carved a unique niche for himself. His books are the product of four to five years of research, a luxury few, if any other journalists are indulged. The emerging portrait of the United States is vivid and full of human detail.",0

Clements,96/99,4.0,1118275200,A very valuable addition for anyone using SBS.,"As a reader who was generally unsatisfied with the first volume in this series, and not greatly experienced with the SBS product, I had mixed feelings about the book. About half of the content is VERY good. The other half seemed almost trivial and shouldn't have been included, or if it were, should have had far greater depth and specificity. Overall though, the value of the good stuff, FAR outweighs the fluff and makes this book a very valuable resource. If this book doesn't save you at least one call to PSS, I'd be very surprised.PROSeveral chapters stood out for both the excellent content and clear writing. Andy Goodman's Advanced Setup and Deployment, Michael Klein's explanation of Exchange Server 2003, Wayne Small's RWW coverage, Alan Shrater's coverage of the use of SQL, Susan Bradley's Advanced Security and Jeff Middleton's Disaster Recovery really make this book a valuable addition to the industry.CONSeveral reviews of additional software didn't do a good job of describing the need for the software and in many cases didn't even mention how much the software would cost. Blatant plugs for Mr. Brelsford's sponsor HP seemed misplaced and contributed to my dissatisfaction with the book. Too many NOTES boxes deprive the reader of content. Coverage of the ISA Server 2004 which hasn't even been released should have been held for the upcoming ""Extending SBS"" which was mentioned several times in the book.Here's how it breaks down.Intro and Bio'sSection 1: SBS 2003 DeploymentChapter 1 Introduction and Planning Harry BrelsfordChapter 2 Understanding Hardware in the SBS Environment Chris AngeliniChapter 3 SBS Licensing Harry Brelsford and Steven BanksChapter 4 Advanced Setup and Deployment Andy GoodmanChapter 5 Using 3rd Party Tools to boost SBS Performance Frank OhlhorstSection 2: SBS 2003 UtilizationChapter 6 Exchange Server 2003: Advanced Topic Michael KleinChapter 7 Windows SharePoint Services: Advanced Topics Jonathan HassellChapter 8 Remote Web Workplace: Advanced Topics Wayne SmallChapter 9 Using MS SQL Server 2000 with SBS 2003 Alan ShraterChapter 10 Fax Server: Advanced Topics Kevin RoyaltySection 3: SBS 2003 SecurityChapter 11 Advanced Security: Part 1 General Susan BradleyChapter 12 Part 2 ISA Server 2004 Beatrice Mulzer and Dr. Tom ShindlerSection 4: SBS Advanced TopicsChapter 13 System Monitoring Lawrence A RodisChapter 14 SBS Disaster Recovery Jeff MiddletonChapter 15 Migration Jeff MiddletonChapter 1 Introduction and Planning by Harry BrelsfordThis is a broad and very general overview of the SBS world. It was noted that another book is in the works on expanding your SBS Premium which will include both BizTalk Server 2004 and CRM 1. Besides these things, I don't know that there was much of great value in this chapter to me.Chapter 2 Understanding Hardware in the SBS Environment by Chris AngeliniThis chapter was more interesting. There is an interesting compare and contrast between AMD's server line of chips and Intel's server line of chips. Tape versus HD backup are discussed, SAS and SATA, workstation requirements and server requirements. Wireless and Gigabit networking is briefly discussed. There is a discussion about ""right-sizing"" hardware for a client based on what the consultant knows about their business and their knowledge of hardware. Little firm guidance is given here and this is one of the areas I think needs to be SIGNIFICANTLY documented by the industry.Of some interest to me was the brief description of the iLo and RILOE II capabilities for remote control of a server at the hardware level. Though the capabilities are described, there is not much mention about how these could be used in a real-world support way. Perhaps I just don't have enough experience to understand this, but then that's what the book is for right? If you're going to market someone's product, one of the best ways is to describe a pain point and then detail how your product alleviates that. I didn't get it.The last 15 pages of the chapter is a walk-through of the HP Proliant HL 350 G4. Harry does a very good job of plugging his sponsors. However, the same information could be conveyed in a similar way without specifically plugging this machine. I failed to glean anything useful from this material. These blatant product plugs help reinforce my opinion that the book's asking price is too high. If HP is going to sponsor the book, and I am expected to read it, my compensation should be a lower sticker price.All told, I can't say that I gleaned much of anything new from this chapter. It is a fair review of modern technologies, but not comprehensive enough to be significant for me.Chapter 3 SBS Licensing by Harry Brelsford and Steven BanksThe example used for the chapter is a creditable one. It is easy to follow and shows the concepts in action.Since Eric Ligman does an EXEMPLARY job handling licensing questions on the mssmallbiz site, I almost wonder about the inclusion of this in the book. I can't say I got a lot of bang out of this chapter. Well written, not largely needed.Chapter 4 Advanced Setup and Deployment by Andy GoodmanBOOM!!! Home Run!! This is exactly the kind of information that I would expect to see. How to use GPO to roll out software... How to use GPO to change computer settings... How to set the time to automatically sync with the server... Using partitions during install...This is the first chapter that I can say that I will use TODAY to get something done.I also very much appreciated the input on creating multiple partitions and why. Andy's hints are the kind of stuff that I haven't heard before, but that can solve challenges I've got right now. EXCELLENT!!Incidentally, Andy's recommendations as given in this chapter are far more inclusive even that what is on his web site (I at least when I wrote this.). They are also very similar to those made in the Microsoft Small Business Server Administrator's Companion (though better explained and illustrated.) They also match recommendations by MBS for installing CRM and disaster recovery recommendations by Jeff Middleton. Interesting that these weren't included in the ""Basic and Intermediate"" book.Chapter 5 Using 3rd Party Tools to boost SBS Performance by Frank OhlhorstThis chapter goes over the backup utility from Acronis' True Image Server. There is no pricing information, which is always a bad sign in my book. There was also no discussion about why this is better than the NTbackup that comes with SBS. There was no justification given for why I might need the additional expense of this software.The next topic covered was hosting with a dynamic IP address. TZO was mentioned and since this often comes in routers as an option, seems a good choice.The last topic was spam filtering. Mr. Ohlhorst discusses how to use GFI Mail Essentials. I haven't used this, but like the backup solution, I wonder why this would be used instead of Intelligent Message Filter for Exchange? Is there such a performance difference that it makes good sense? $300 for a 10-user license when IMF is free tends to make me think there might at least be some attempt to justify this expense.Overall, the chapter was a disappointment to me. Spending money is not always a bad thing. The ultimate determinant is VALUE. If I spend ""X"" amount of dollars I will get ""Y"" feature which benefits me in ""Z"" way and makes it all worth while. There was hardly any of this type of information.Chapter 6 Exchange Server 2003: Advanced Topic by Michael KleinWOW!! 140 pages on just about anything you could want to know about Exchange. This is a veritable treasure trove of how to install, maintain, troubleshoot, monitor, and enhance Exchange Server 2003. There is actually so much that is covered here that it is difficult to describe it all.I have found that reading books on Exchange seems to often be a waste of time. So much of the content is based on running in an enterprise environment and thus completely not related to SBS-Exchange at all. This is by far, the best overview of Exchange that I have ever read. The nuts and bolts of how it sends mail and even tools to diagnose problems are discussed.Given the complexity of this very mature product and the essential nature of e-mail for a business, this chapter alone might justify the cost of the book. Very thorough and well-written. I could easily imagine that this could save the cost of a call to PSS. If this chapter doesn't have the answer to your Exchange question, I'll bet it will have something that will put you on the right track to finding it.Chapter 7 Windows SharePoint Services: Advanced Topics by Jonathan HassellI think this chapter was a disappointment. Almost four whole pages were spent enumerating fixes covered in Service Pack 1. How is this important to me? Post a link, and I'll hit it if I want. Show me how to do NEW stuff. Two of the other examples mentioned are just screenshots of what Microsoft has on their SharePoint spot.There is good information on linking Access to WSS. Frankly, I agree with Harry's comments from the last book, that SharePoint may well be the greatest reason to upgrade to Office 2003. I am amazed at what this makes possible.There is also information on backing up and restoring SharePoint via the stsadmin tool, the migrate tool and also the SQL backup tool. This is very timely information. However, I have to wonder why this wouldn't have been presented in the ""Basic and Intermediate"" book.Perhaps the author had a conflict of interest in writing this chapter as it looks like he charges a lot of money for training sessions on customizing SharePoint. I was surprised to see that he mentions an application of SharePoint and the screenshot didn't seem to have anything to do with the functionality he mentions.Chapter 8 Remote Web Workplace: Advanced Topics by Wayne SmallAh, refreshing detail here. Wayne does a great job of identifying what functionality is needed, by whom and with which devices. He covers RWW in excellent detail along with extensive troubleshooting. His coverage even includes editing the registry to change details which may be significant to your RWW setup. This chapter is the first to really earn the ""Advanced"" label.This chapter is very well written and provides significant value for the reader. The troubleshooting tips and the website he has which can help would be a great way to justify this book. Having all of this information in an easy to access place is greatly helpful. The detail in the troubleshooting part could be sufficient to save a call to PSS.Chapter 9 Using MS SQL Server 2000 with SBS 2003 by Alan ShraterThis is a breakthrough chapter. I think the content is sufficient to allow one to conceive of other uses, but not so thorough that it is all inclusive.This section of the book is well written. It encourages the reader to think more outside of the box as far as how to use SQL and its benefits over just Access. This is one of the few places so far in the book, where there has been an effort made to justify the additional cost of the upgrade. I think the Mr. Shrater succeeds admirably. I thought he did a really good job of describing how SQL and Access can co-exist happily.One of the other excellent resources is the listing of recommended reading. I think this article will really help implementation of Premium installations and help people see a bigger picture than previously.Chapter 10 Fax Server: Advanced Topics Kevin RoyaltyI may not be a good judge for this chapter. I don't use fax much, and am frankly surprised that it persists as much as it does, given how much more flexible e-mail is.I will say that the chapter flowed well and seemed to make sense. After a review of hardware that seems to be a listing of the most expensive faxes available, the process of setting up different fax configurations was gone over. Dealing with 10 digit dialing and 7 digit dialing in the same environment is also covered.Chapter 11 Advanced Security: Part 1 General by Susan BradleyWow! I have had the opportunity to listen to Susan Bradley before. She has a website at www.sbsdiva.com and I've been there many times looking for answers.I'd bet that I've read or heard of 60% of the security stuff that she talks about in this chapter. This is the first time I've seen so much of it in so coherent a presentation.The chapter is largely generalities: assessing risk, mitigating risk, implementing a defense, evaluating and even recovering. There are a wide array of security tools mentioned, sites to reference, procedures to understand.This is a very well presented writing on the subject. I think it is a useful reference for anyone using SBS. Her thinking is very much based on handling real world situations and protecting the digital assets of a company.This chapter alone may well be a good reason to buy this book. You can probably find all of the information she presents somewhere else, but having it all right at your fingertips is a very good thing and a GREAT time saver.I was particularly impressed with the discussion about changing permissions to allow programs which profess to require the ""Administrator"" role to run safely in lower permission levels.The large number of third party tools listed along with other websites to go to for more information will also be very valuable to the reader.I hesitate to say that I enjoyed this chapter, because I didn't. Security and all of its inherent pains is one of my least favorite aspects of the computing world. However, it is the state of the world today and having read this, I am better equipped to deal with it.Chapter 12 Advanced Security: Part 2 ISA Server 2004 by Beatrice Mulzer and Dr. Tom ShindlerThis chapter was written without the benefit of having seen even the beta for the SP1 implementation of ISA 2004 for SBS 2003 Premium customers. You'll see this phrase often: Visit http://www.smbnation.com/isaupdates.html for when an updated version of this chapter is available.There are some examples of tasks and screenshots, but as the software hasn't been released yet, it seems that this would have been a good candidate for the next volume.Chapter 13 System Monitoring by Lawrence A RodisThis chapter is well written and easy to follow. References are given for further research. Both Microsoft and non-Microsoft tools are mentioned, and many of the third-party tools are free for small networks. There was no pricing information given on the other tools which is a pet peeve of mine.Several charts of events and services to be monitored are given. There is a list for hardware performance, Exchange, and ISA. It is mentioned that other apps that the business depends on also need to be monitored.Rodis mentions that with some of the tools, the ability to scale up the number of systems has been significantly improved. This is a very good thing as it is exactly where I presume many of the readers of this chapter would like to be.Chapter 14 SBS Disaster Recovery by Jeff MiddletonExcellent!! Jeff Middleton has done a fantastic job of covering this subject. The beginning of the 110 page chapter covers the boot process, what happens when and how to recover if it goes wrong.There is extensive coverage of recovering from a problem using various different methods, including ASR, a backup, and a drive image. There is discussion of potential problem areas with specialized applications like SQL and SharePoint and how to work around them.Different tools are described and how to use them. Exchange and its components and how to fix and recover them are described.It is difficult to describe all that is described in the process of this chapter. I think Jeff's writing is some of the most clear and concise of the authors included. His experience and confidence are displayed by the easily readable explanations of some pretty technical concepts.It was interesting to me that Jeff is the only author who refers to the Product Support Services Team as an option in his writing. It is clear that he has been willing to jump in over his head and make things happen. He refers people to his website at sbsmigration.com for further assistance with Disaster Recovery or his Swing Migration method.His experience with the Disaster Recovery methods he writes about are the inspiration for his Swing Migration method. This method, covered in the next chapter, was highly lauded at the SMB Nation 2004. He was the only author there to get a standing ovation. (That I saw anyway.)This is another of the chapters which makes this book such a valuable asset to have.Chapter 15 SBS Disaster Recovery by Jeff MiddletonI didn't read this chapter before getting this done, and haven't gone back to do so.",1

"War In A Time Of Peace - Bush, Clinton, And The Generals",,,,,,,,,,B000IX2YO4,,A23SB6VGGB9E8U,"Craig L. Howe ""The Pointed Pundit""",96/99,5.0,1002758400,Ghosts of Vietnam Haunt 1990s American Foreign Policy,"I had a professor who defined journalism as ""history written in a hurry."" In his sequel to The Best And The Brightest author David Halberstam uses the journalist's tools - personal interviews and background research - to explore how the shadow of Vietnam and the Cold War shaped the United States' foreign policy during the 1990s.What emerges, is a thoughtful, portrait of the United States from the perspective of its foreign policy decisions. It is a book written for thoughtful citizens; a book that, clearly, was not written in a hurry; a book that unearths the struggles, egos and the political maneuvering among the key figures in The White House, the State Department and the military. Halberstam shows how the decisions of Vietnam War Veterans, like Colin Powell and Anthony Lake, and those who were not, like President William Clinton, influenced American politics and policy.Lesser-known players who contributed to the picture were not overlooked. Halberstam notes that the irony of the Gulf War was the wrong branch of the service and the wrong military leaders were celebrated at its conclusion. Norman Schwarzkopf and Colin Powell received ovations for their humiliation of an allegedly mighty, but now bedraggled Iraqi Army.If one man was responsible, he notes, it was an innovative air force strategist, Colonel John Warden. At the time of the Gulf War, Warden was the head of a top-secret air force group working within The Pentagon and represented a group of younger military officers who were eager to adapt military thinking and planning to the uses of the new technological advanced weaponry.The major opposition to his thinking came not from the army or even civilians, but rather senior officers in his service branch, especially three and four star generals attached to the Tactical Air Command. They believed the airpower was there to support the army on the ground. They despised Warden and his ideas. As luck would have it, when General Schwarzkopf requested an air plan for Desert Storm, Warden's senior officer was on leave and the request found its way to his desk.Roy Gutman, an American reporter who happened to be in Yugoslavia in 1991 and was starting to write what would be a series of prophetic dispatches for Newsday, the Long Island, New York daily, is another unknown player. Stationed in Belgrade from 1973 to 1975 as a Reuter's correspondent, he had embraced what he termed as ""the golden age of Tito"", a Serbo-centrism that tempered the vision of many western diplomats and journalists.On his return in 1991 he saw signs that Yugoslavia was becoming a different country. An interview with Vojislav Seselj, an ultra nationalist Serb who had once been jailed by Tito for his ethnic views and was known for his personal cruelty, convinced the journalist that something sinister was about to happen with its likely epicenter as Banja Luka, a city in Northern Bosnia, which time which prove to be the home of the Serbian campaign of ethnic cleansing.Halberstam's search for the real story behind the headlines gives the reader clear insights into why events in the Balkans, Haiti and Somalia reflect American foreign policy and politics. He discusses the wariness of the U. S. military to ever be caught again in a ground war lacing clear objectives, the frustrations of political leaders who never served in the military and their effects on American commanders in Kosovo.On the last page of the book, the author allows himself a glimpse into our future, which in light of the events of September 11, 2001 proves tragically prescient. Writing in May, 2001, Halberstam, allows himself to speculate about the need for a missile shield, what he terms ""a high-tech Maginot Line, the wrong idea at the wrong time."" He notes that intelligence analysts believe ""the threat to an open society like America c[o]mes from terrorists, rather than the military power of rogue states"" which themselves present an exceptional target.The author has carved a unique niche for himself. His books are the product of four to five years of research, a luxury few, if any other journalists are indulged. The emerging portrait of the United States is vivid and full of human detail.",0

It helped me to identify those inherent gifts (talents) which I possess and gave me specific insights into how best to apply them. In fact, after reading the book, I contacted Rallph Mattson and went through his Motif process (based upon the book). From this report they prepared a &quot;best use&quot; analysis which I regularly share with my management in discussions of next assignments and promotions. It has helped me and them to jointly make career decisions that benefit me and the company. The book's philosophical basis is supported by a new book (1999) by Gallup &quot;First Break all the Rules&quot;. After interviewing 40,000 people in 800 companies, they found that the one thing that most negatively impacts an organization's ability to reach its full potential is its inability to tap into and utilize the unique, inherent talents of each person in the organization. The one thing Gallup does not offer is a means of identifying those talents and putting them to use. Ralph Mattson (who published his book well in advance of Gallup's) has a proven, effective means of doing that. I strongly urge anyone who is or has ever wondered if there was something else that would make them feel fulfilled or give them a sense of peace and contentment, to read this book.",1

(I must admit that everytime I read Rogers' dialogue in ""Northwest Passage"" I hear the voice of Spencer Tracy.) Anyway ""Northwest Passage,"" the novel, is actually made up of two very different books.Book I is one of the finest pieces of historical fiction that I have ever read. It's the story of Rogers' Rangers attack on the Abenaki Indian village of St. Francis during the French and Indian War. The story revolves around a fictional character, Langdon Towne, an upper middle class lad who wants to become a great artist by painting ""true life"" subjects such as Indians. Fleeing a dispute with local crooked politicians, Towne joins Major Rogers and his Rangers on the eve of their departure for St. Francis. What happens next is a thrilling story. Roberts' descriptions of the northern New England terrain, the agony of fatigue and starvation, and the gruesome depiction of the barbaric nature of war are stunning to read. Also amazing is the depiction of Major Rogers as seen through the worshipful eyes of Towne. The reader will finish Book I with a heroic image of Rogers as an indefatigable, courageous, clever tactician and born leader.Book II, though, is a disappointment. Of course, it is very understandable that Book II is a let down, since Book I can hardly be topped as a historical adventure. Roberts' spends most of Book II tearing down the heroic image of Rogers that he built-up in Book I. Alcohol, debt, political enemies, a bad marriage, and his own vices reduce Rogers to a rather pathetic character. Book II also suffers from a lack of focus- we follow Towne as he develops into a famous painter from New England, to England, to the Upper Great Lakes, to Canada, back to England, and then to New England. Unlike Book I, which dealt with just a few short months of time, Book II is all over the place. However, the biggest problem with Book II is that nothing really happens in it- just Rogers' long decline and Towne's search for fulfillment.Finally, Kenneth Roberts' books usually contain some extremely well developed and strong female characters, but ""Northwest Passage"" is lacking in this department. The interesting character of Jennie Coit disappears quickly. And Anne Potter, who had the possibility to be extremely interesting, is just too thinly drawn.""Northwest Passage's"" Book I is a terrific piece of historical fiction. I cannot speak more highly of it. However, Book II drags, and is really only interesting in that illustrates what happens to the characters introduced in Book I. Book II is actually just a very long and detailed epilogue to Book I.",1

"CCNA Certification Library: (CCNA Self Study, Exam #640-801)",,['Wendell Odom'],,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Ylv_PAAACAAJ&dq=CCNA+Certification+Library:+(CCNA+Self+Study,+Exam&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Addison-Wesley,2004-08-01,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Ylv_PAAACAAJ&dq=CCNA+Certification+Library:+(CCNA+Self+Study,+Exam&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Computers'],,0536172501,,A2OFCKJIKUJSVW,Prime Meridian,96/98,4.0,1072915200,"Great for the comprehensive CCNA exam (640-801), but...","First, let me tell you where I'm coming from so you know what kind of spin this review has. I studied for the CCNA about two years ago using Lammle's CCNA book first and then Odom's, but I never got around to taking the exam. Now I'm trying to ramp back up to take the comprehensive CCNA exam (640-801). One thing I can say for certain is the study materials from Odom and Cisco Press have improved over the last two years.In case you didn't pick it up in the description, the ""CCNA Certification Library (CCNA Self-Study, exam #640-801), Sixth Edition"" contains two volumes: the ""CCNA INTRO Exam Certification Guide (CCNA Self-Study, 640-821, 640-801)"" and the ""CCNA ICND Exam Certification Guide (CCNA Self-Study, 640-811, 640-801)"". If you're planning to take the comprehensive 640-801 exam, go ahead and get this Library with the two books - they cover all the material on the 640-801 as well as the material for the two separate exams.First, the good news:- One pleasant side effect of Cisco's decision to split the CCNA into two exams is that the Cisco Press review materials are now split into two volumes. Tell me, how many of you resented having to schlep around that monolith 640-607 Certification Guide? Well, now there are two volumes - one for each exam required for the CCNA. Now you have the option of just taking ""half a book"" with you while studying for the comprehensive exam.-The INTRO and ICND books were designed to be used together to prepare for the 640-801. The books include a reading map that shows which sections in each book should be read in what order. This lets you get complete coverage of each major topic before you move on to the next.- Another nice feature of the books is the ""Do I Know This Already?"" quiz at the beginning of each chapter. If you've been involved in networking for a while or you've studied for the CCNA before (like me), taking these quizzes can keep you from wasting time reading about things you already know. Taking them also keeps you from possibly missing some arguably odd things that Cisco deem important enough to include in the exam(s).- Odom and Cisco Press definitely do a much better job explaining networking fundamentals. If you're new networking and/or the CCNA, you'll definitely want to start with the INTRO volume. Basic concepts are covered there first and, in my opinion, covered well.- The accompanying CDs include PDFs of the books. Also, the exam and router simulators on the included CDs are a nice bonus, but I already have a couple of 2501's and a 1900 at home I can use for lab scenarios.Now, the bad news:- The bane of all technical exam guides: ERRATA!!! Although the number of errors in these books is way down since the 640-607 Certification Guide (49 vs. 80 at last count), to me, nothing is more obnoxious or problematic than a test preparation book with errors. We use these books to learn and study. Whenever there's an error it undermines the learning and that defeats the purpose of the book. What I'd like to know is how those 49 errors got past the *three* CCIE's who were the Technical Reviewers for the books.- Some of the figures are counter-intuitive. For example, some of the figures in the INTRO book showed data flowing from right to left. We read left to right, so using diagrams that move right to left seemed a little perplexing.- For some inexplicable reason the PDF versions of the books on the CDs are of the 1st printing while the books are 2nd printings. This will drive you nuts when you start finding errors on the PDFs that aren't in the printed versions.Even with these problems, this Library is the best bang for the buck when it comes to preparing for either the comprehensive 640-801 or the INTRO and ICND exams. As a bonus, it's written by Cisco Press, so it's much more likely the material you see on the exams will have been part of your reading. If you do get the library and install the exam simulators, make sure you download the update from the Cisco Press Web site; it takes care of some errata in the test engine.I'm giving this Library 4 stars due to the number of errors in the books and the disparity between the versions of the printed books and the included PDFs. Overall, those may be small quibbles on my part. Regardless, short of attending the Cisco Networking Academy, this Library is the best prep you can get for taking either the comprehensive CCNA exam or the two separate exams.",1

But then, is it really an accomplishment to publish a book when you have to actually pay the publisher to do it?Enough about the author, the book is terrible. It seems to grasp the idea of a beginning, middle, and ending, but little else about the art of storytelling. Its attempts at creativity are akin to a five year-old having a massive battle with his action figures: he grabbed a bunch of other people's archetypes and put them in a bizarre configuration of events imitating his favorite books and movies. And like a child going on about how his dinosaur from the distant future is about to fight a ghost cowboy, the kid is rarely coherent and really only amusing themselves. The points where it tries to wax philosophically are silly enough to make even a child roll their eyes. The dialogue is stiff and hackneyed, riddled with lines you couldn't say aloud with gagging. People whip out books and start reading to one another in the middle of fight scenes.Obnoxious, worthless, [...]. Avoid it at all costs, no matter how many negative reviews he deletes.",1

Juliette has been breeding, naturally rearing, showing, and traveling the world with her Champion Afghans since the 1930s. This book is dedicated to her Turkuman Afghan Hounds who &quot;have never known disease.&quot; As always, Juliette is opinionated, uncompromising, cantankerous, and a tad eccentric, but also full of wisdom and vast amounts of valuable info, and every one of her books makes a fascinating read. The first section of this book deals with nutrition (she emphasizes the importance of feeding a raw diet), breeding and natural rearing (no vaccines, insecticides, etc.) while the second part deals with herbal remedies for everything from mange to distemper. Of course most of her suggestions are out of synch with current veterinary advice, but our own naturally reared Wirehaired Pointers and many other dogs like them are living proof that her methods work -- extremely well. Our dogs have remained disease and parasite-free without vaccines, worming pills, insecticides, antibiotics, steroids, etc. The best protection we can give our beloved Wires is a strong immune system, and all of the above have the effect of weakening our animals' immune systems. Even if you are not ready to go &quot;all natural,&quot; this book will make you question the conventional wisdom and hopefully encourage you to further research the many harmful practices (e.g., annual booster shots, combo vaccines, antibiotics and/or steroids for every minor infection, routine wormings, feeding of commercial convenience foods with highly questionable ingredients, etc.) we have learned to accept as both necessary and harmless.",1

She develops a theory about memory and about transcendent experience in this essay. She discusses her powerful drive to reshape and write about the past: &quot;I feel that strong emotion must leave its trace; and it is only a question of discovering how we can get ourselves attached to it, so that we shall be able to live our lives through from the start.&quot; In this essay Woolf proposes that in moments of ecstasy we have a meaningful vision of the world itself: &quot;it is a constant idea of mine; that behind the cotton wool is hidden a pattern; that we--I mean all human beings--are connected with this; that the whole world is a work of art; that we are parts of the work of art.

"Holding Hands, Holding Hearts: Recovering a Biblical View of Christian Dating","What does the Bible say about dating? Nothing. And everything! This book offers a biblical view of relationships and provides insight on issues of commitment, attraction, and more. The challenge before us is to think biblically about an activity that isn't in the Bible and that may expose us to worldly attitudes and behaviors. When you date someone, you're more than just holding another's hands; you're holding that person's heart. We hope to show in this book that the Bible presents profound instruction and wisdom that may be directly applied to dating and that will help us to be blessed in dating relationships. - Publisher.","['Richard D.

Vosseller ""davhoops""",96/98,5.0,1148083200,Clear Biblical Thinking and Practical Application,"The dating versus courtship arguments in my opinion, have largely fallen into two inadequate camps. Courtship (often) is defended as the preferable option because it was the norm in Biblical culture. Our modern context is usually written off while the cultural practice of the past becomes the normative Biblcal command for us now. I had trouble making that leap. And I found that many who ""kissed dating good-bye"" made it into a Biblical command, rather than what it is, a wise application of Biblical principles. The other side, who ""gave dating a chance"", often failed to wrestle significantly with the Biblical material and empahsized following Biblical principles within the flawed system of dating.Thankfully, into this debate comes a third and welcome approach. Richard Phillips and Sharon Phillips are both aware of the modern context that singles live in, but also have attempted to create a thoroughly Biblical rationale for single males and females to follow as they ""date"". Holding Hands, Holding Hearts is all that a book on practical theology should be. It is grace-based, well thought out, Scripturally supported and developed, and it gives practical applications for its readers. (While I believe all theology is practical, many books fail to thoroughly examine the practical outworkings of theology in day-to-day life).The book is divided into two parts. Part I is called A Biblical View of Dating and Relationships. In this half, the Phillips spend a significant time explaining why we are what we are and how that affects our relationships. It uses the classical set up of categories for mankind - Creation, Fall, and Redemption. All three need to be understood BEFORE a model of relationships is developed, and the Phillips do this in a clear, Biblical and understandable way. The second half is titled Biblical Wisdom for Dating and Relationships. It takes the Bibles teachings on marriage and works backwards from them. The patterns that God desires in marriage do not magically appear once one is married, and this book describes how a couple can and should learn, grow and prepare for the roles they are called to if the Lord calls them to marriage.One highlight that I have not seen in any dating/courtship book before is the section on idolatry in our hearts. Here's a sample: ""Different people have different idols as we saw in Genesis 3, the woman's idols will often be relationship-oriented; she desires to possess him as the key to her happiness....Similarly, Genesis 3 tells us that men will often be motivated by idols eternal to the relationship: money, power, excitement. Whatever they are, the point is that idols must be served, and the dating or marriage partner must be coerced into contributing to that service. This, by the way, is often what the world means by 'compatibility'. The key to a happy relationship, the experts tell us, is to find a companion who worships the same idols as you do, or whose idols are at least not in conflict with your own. This is a fool's paradise, for sin and idolatry never truly produce harmony but always strife."" (pp. 61-62). This section, in addition to many others, has what many other Christian books on the subject lack, a proper understanding and focus on the heart, as well as practical guidlines for conduct based on that understanding. Pastor Phillips is definitely a shepherd, and a man who ""has no need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth"" (2 Tim. 2:15 ESV).If you are a single adult, and want to have the best theological and practical undestanding of how to keep Christ at the center of your dating relationships (or your courtship relationships) - this is the book for you! It is easy to read, Christ-honoring, and very practical. It also is very pastoral, and has the benefit of both male and female input, and all this from two people who worked with hundreds of singles over the years.As one final note, my girlfriend(now wife) and I read this together, and it was a great resource and catalyst for our thinking as we sought the Lord's will for our relationship.

So far so good.For those of you unaware, Robertie, former two time world champion, has already written many books on backgammon and together with Kent Goulding co-published the sadly now defunct, but at the time premier magazine ""Inside Backgammon"".As the title suggests, it is a compilation of 501 problems, split 360 checker plays v 141 cube actions. (67 doubles 74 redoubles). After the introductory chapters covering notation/probability/basic doubling strategy etc, there are 26 chapters covering many of the important concepts in backgammon from the opening to the bearoff. These are:The Opening, Flexibility, The Middle Game, The 5-point, One Man Back, Priming Games, Connectivity, Hit Or Not?, Crunch Positions, Action Doubles, Late Game Blitz, Post-Blitz Turnaround Games, Ace-Point Games Back Games, The Containment, Game Post-Ace-Point Games, Saving The Gammon, The Race, Various Endgames, Bearing Off Against Contact, The Blitz, Breaking Anchor, Too Good To Double?, Playing For A Gammon, The Bearoff, Holding Games,The book manages to cram the 501 positions and analyses into 384 pages of a book measuring just 23x15cms. This is achieved by squashing the diagrams with the effect of making the checkers oval. The problems in each chapter are all bunched together first and the solutions at the end of the chapter hence cutting down on the need to avoid looking at the analysis.It's target audience is everybody from beginner to expert level. The only group that maybe wouldn't find many parts of this book valuable would be world class players.The problems are typical of positions that appear in everyday backgammon and not unusual or tricky positions that an expert may get wrong. The difficulty of the problems range from very easy to hard with the majority in the intermediate/advanced level. My guess is that the book would be suitable to players ranked up to elo 1900 on F.I.B.S. or Gamesgrid. Robertie has attempted to create a book of reference positions whose characteristics the reader can hopefully remember and apply and adapt over the board and for each problem, he typically gives a succinct 8-10 line analysis.There are no references to any of the neural net backgammon programs in the book. I checked all the positions by rollout and did discover some disagreements between the bots' conclusions and Robertie's analysis. There were around 12 cube problems whose equity differed by more than 0.04 and also some checker play differences. Some of those positions would make good reading for the more expert players.My only major criticism on the book is that in some of the checker play problems Robertie doesn't analyse all the potential choices or rejects one when in fact the equities are quite close.The reasoning behind this maybe that that the merits of that checker play do not fit in with the theme of the chapter or are too complex. And on a personal note I prefer to see the pip count in diagrams.Overall an excellent book suitable for either beginners who have learned the very basics or a good refresher book for more advanced players.

Pippi Longstocking,,,,,,,,,,B000NRA2KI,,AMX0PJKV4PPNJ,"E. R. Bird ""Ramseelbird""",96/98,4.0,1088121600,Pip pip and tarry ho!,"To my mind, Pippi Longstocking is perhaps the world's first child superhero. Able to lift strong policemen with her bare hands! Capable of climbing tall houses and trees with virtually no effort at all! Rescuing children from burning buildings and adults from snobby talk! If, like myself, you were a child of the 1980s then your first exposure to Miss Longstocking probably came in the form of that gawdawful movie circa 1988. Words alone cannot express the damage that film did to the youth of America. After watching it I avoided the book ""Pippi Longstocking"" like it was the plague itself. Only recently have I recanted and decided to read Astrid Lindgren's classic tale. As charming as it is outright bizarre I charge all of you to take the time to find and devour this little Swedish gem. Pippi's a pip, no question.Working at wish fulfillment on about ten different levels, Pippi is the ultimate kid's kid. She lives all alone in a large fantastic house. Her mother died while she was but a babe and her father has been lost at sea. As optimistic regarding her father's return as Primrose Squarp in ""Everything On a Waffle"", Pippi fills her days with dancing, pancakes, and games. She owns a whole suitcase of gold coins, which allow her the freedom to live alone and untended. On top of that, she has her own monkey (the drolly named Mr. Nilsson) and horse. The neighbor children Annika and Tommy think (rightly so) that Pippi's a wonder. She never attends school or bothers with all the problems other children suffer. Instead, she has her own unique perspective on life and the people around her. Though precocious she's never mean, even when dealing with bullies or criminals.The book, originally published in American in 1950, is a wonder. Though I'm certain other illustrators have done a fair job, I highly recommend that you seek out an edition illustrated by the talented Louis S. Glanzman. His Pippi is just as fabulous as you might hope her to be. I've always minded those Pippi's that seem a little too lanky or tough. This Pippi is just mischief incarnate. While you're out seeking an edition of this book illustrated by Glanzman, also make certain that the translation has been done by Florence Lamborn. There were some moments of trans-atlantic interpretation that just blew me away. For example, when confronted by evil bullies numerous in number, the biggest and meanest of them eyes Pippi and says, ""boys, let Willie alone and take a look at this girl. What a babe!"". Obviously that phrase must've meant something entirely different in 1950, but I was incredibly amused by it just the same. Other funny moments caught my eye. For one thing, Pippi and her friends are forever drinking coffee. Not given the ""adult drink"" status it has in the states, coffee is definitely the drink of choice of Swedish youth. And there was also the difficulty the translator had with verbal puns. Some of these had to be worked around by explaining what a word means in English. Without these explanations the book's jokes would fall flat.Finally, my favorite chapter of the book. It was the chapter in which Pippi is invited to a fancy coffee party (see what I meant about kids and coffee?). Pippi attempts desperately to mix and mingle appropriately with the middle-aged lady guests there. When the women start putting down their hired help, Pippi is more than eager to tell multiple increasingly bizarre stories of her grandmother's servant Malin. The ways in which Pippi tells Milan tales becomes more and more extreme until at the end she screams towards the women from the other end of the block, ""SHE NEVER SWEPT UNDER THE BEDS"". I think you'll have to read the chapter yourself to see just how increasingly hilarious it becomes. It's fabulous stuff.Every country has its resident red headed heroine.

Never an Outbreak: The New Breakthrough Method that Stops the Herpes Virus and Eliminates All Outbreaks,,,,,,,,,,0965187500,,A1H1C2UZ6FH0YL,"Johnfourtytwo ""tired and almost retired""",96/98,5.0,1126137600,Natural Treatment,"I bought this book from the writer's website since it wasn't available from any of the other online booksellers because it was out-of-print.It's written in easy-to-read plain English. The author admits up front in the Introduction that he isn't a doctor but he has a Bachelors of Science degree and research and development is his experience. In 1993 he was diagnosed with herpes and he spent the next two years reading everything he could find on herpes and viruses.After that, he put all that information together and tried it on himself. The procedures he came up with worked and he claims to be herpes-free (no more symptoms at least). He then put it all together in this book. It's only 61 pages long but it has a lot of good information in it without all the medical jargon to fill up white space and confuse you. Besides the simple procedures to tackle the virus without any side-effects for most people, he claims a 100% success-rate with everyone who's used his system.I was diagnosed years ago with herpes but I've never had the serious outbreaks that others have. I've been using the procedures in his book for two months now and the one symptom I had went away soon after I started his procedures. The procedures are basically a slight diet and exercise change, vitamins, supplements, and a couple natural and herbal topical and oral treatments. I've had no side-effects other than the loss of symptoms.I'm not saying it will work for everyone, but it has worked for me. The only failures (3%) I know of is when people stray from the program or get reinfected and once they got back on track with the program they were a success also.I most definitely recommend this book to anyone with herpes.",1

His now-deceased intruder carries no I.D., and as a former Florida state investigator, Stranahan knows there are plenty of potential culprits. His long list of enemies includes an off point hit man, a personal injury lawyer of billboard fame, a notoriously irritating TV journalist, and a fumbling plastic surgeon.

What is wonderful about his books, apart from the zany characters, great dialogue and memorable absurdaties, is that in each one we see the 'forces of evil' suffer the fates they deserve. Maybe good doesn't triumph in real life, but Hiassen gives us the satisfaction of seeing horrible things happen to horrible people.In Skin Tight, Hiassen gives us his usual cast of interesting and very peculiar players drawn from the mix of modern day Miami. Without giving any of the plot away, I will only say that there are two things about this book that I bet will stay with any reader: the fate that befalls the vain and insufferable TV host in his Geraldolike quest at expose and the character Chemo's choice of a prosthesis - a weed-whacker. These are a couple of the overthetop high points in Skin Tight, one of Hiaseen's grizzliest and funniest tales.",1

Here you go!,"Cech writes a book I've been waiting for - something truly in depth that talks about tinctures in more than just a paragraph or so. While saying it's perfectly fine to make tinctures in the 'simplers manner' - and he explains how to do this - his reasons for making consistent batches with measurements for continued accuracy and control makes perfect sense. He brings up the merits many herbalists do regarding the benefits of alcohol as a medium - besides preserving the herbal properties better than other products in nature, besides working better to extract from most herbs over glycerine and ACV, and besides bringing up how alcohol is such a wonderful carrier of herbs or other substances through the bloodstream into the body, he brings up the important points on how little of alcohol is consumed when taking the standard tincture dose, and eases some common misconceptions. Several chapters are devoted to tinctures alone, through various ways of extracting, detailed information on straining, pressing, and sifting. Things I've never read anywhere else were in here, quite a treat considering all the herbals I've read out there.But of course that's not all. Full chapters are devoted to glycerites and which herbs are best suited for them, Vinegar extracts, Teas and Decoctions, Herbal Syrups and Succi, Oils, Salves, Creams, Poultices, Soaks, and Compresses. The best herbs for each are given, with examples, and it's hard to walk away without being more confident than if you read other standard herbals briefly brushing over this important aspect of herbalism.A true gem of Making Plant Medicine is the Herbal Formulary, which showcases over 500 herbs with each having it's exact best method of preparation discussed, as well as ratio. Before reading this, for example, I hadn't known Astraglus was best extracted in water with just a bit of alcohol to preserve as an unusual type of tincture/tea, rather than just a tincture alone. Tidbits about my favorite herbs makes this book priceless. It's backed with contradictions and use of each herb, and even packs more punch by delivering personal testimonials, dosages, and - of course - a full chapter devoted exclusively to the mathematics of tincturing. Marvelous!Written in a straight forward, down to earth, and enthusiastic manner, it's hard not to get excited about herbs all over again when you read the stories of Richo and his family, their adventures with the herbs, and how complex our plants and bodies really are. A book that does not merely skim the surface in any stretch of the imagination.",1

The Wizard Twins must claim their Sorceress mate. The Wizard Twins of House Veraga, Lasan and Drago, have found their mate, but have been unable to claim her due to her unreasonable fear of joining with the brothers. It seems there are more than mere maidenly fears at work here and the two men must figure out how to ease her into their life and their bed.Princesses Brianna of House Sellane, the ruling family of the Covenani, is the chosen consort of Lasan and Drago, but due to the separation of the Wizards and Sorceresses she has heard horrible tales of the painful mating that Wizard Twins subject their consorts. She is fearful, and she is the most stubborn creature imaginable! She fights her attraction to both Twins, but soon realizes that her body and her power will not be denied.Unfortunately, there are evil forces at work to prevent the alliance and rebalance of power and Brianna soon discovers that even her own house is no longer safe. With the emergence of her power soon at hand and the dangers surrounding her, Lasan and Drago have run out of time to persuade the little princess there will be no pain or harm to her as their consort, only incredible pleasure. In order for them to join as mates, the joining must take place at the moment her power emerges and that time is now.Can Brianna overcome her lifelong fears of mating with Wizard Twins? Can Lasan and Drago keep the princess safe? And the other Wizard Twins? They must all claim their consorts to right the magick in the world. This is a time of great peril and only the strongest can rebuild all that was lost.What a sensual read! The imagination involved in this work is unbelievable. There are strong, interesting, funny characters and situations mixed with just the right amount of danger. For the fantasy lover, this is for you! Don't miss out!",1

Whether the reader is drawn to meditation, drumming, dream work, deep imagery, befriending the dark, wandering in nature, working with shadow or any one of more than a score more approaches to living a soul-based life, Bill Plotkin challenges us to live our true callings, and provides us the means with which to do so.Soulcraft engaged me both experientially and philosophically, calling me to both act and think. It's no accident that Thomas Berry wrote the foreword, or that Brian Swimme, Angeles Arrien, Robert Johnson, and Derrick Jensen, among others, praised the book before publication.Bill Plotkin, in the words of David Whyte, whose poetry graces many of these pages, carries ""what is hidden as a gift to others.""

I have taught students with the same characteristics that she describes in MY POSSE DON'T DO HOMEWORK, GIRLS AT THE BACK OF THE CLASS and TEACHING OUTSIDE THE BOX.Out of all of the resources about methods of teaching, TEACHING OUTSIDE THE BOX tops my list of the greatest. 95 percent of the other resources like Harry Wong's THE FIRST DAYS OF SCHOOL always assume that every teacher has no more than 20 students in the class and that most students are highly motivated and respectful of all of their teachers. Ms. Johnson, on the other hand, addresses the ""what if your methods do not work""? She describes endless specific examples of what exactly a teacher could do if a teacher has more than 40 students in a class and it seems like no one is listening or on task.While Ms. Johnson offers some of her fabulous lesson plans like on ROMEO AND JULIET, she also explains psychological theories of possibilities why difficult kids and even difficult adults behave the way they do.I also love how this terrific resource includes the letter that Ms. Johnson sends to all of her students. She further printed actual letters from kids and adults asking her for her advice, which I found both entertaining and tear jerking.

The examples are taken from around the world (although the authors are Swedish / Irish, so many examples are from their own family.) But what I really like about the book is the emphasis they give to all of the 'related issues' of raising a bilingual child--not just what's the best way to get children to speak, read and write two languages (although that's part of what the book covers), but also issues like: how do you deal with a situation where you always speak to your child in a language your spouse or parents-in-law don't understand, and not make them feel left out? What about when your child has to take foreign language classes at school for a language he's already fluent in (and maybe speaks better than the teacher, or at least thinks he does)? If you're the parent who speaks the minority language, how do you maintain your fluency in that language when no one else near you speaks it? And does it bother you that when you speak to your child in a minority language when you're out in public, that you attract attention, or that other people perceive you as a foreigner who can't speak the majority language properly? How do you deal with cultural differences in &quot;bringing up children properly&quot; (British people may expect children to play quietly, Scandianvian children are expected to take off their shoes when they come into someone's home, in some cultures physical proximity is much less and people hug and stand close in a way that might be uncomfortable for other cultures, etc.) How do you change the rules of what's 'good behaviour' when you travel? What about when grandparents are visiting? Growing up in a family where the parents come from different countries or cultures is a whole lot more than learning to speak two languages, and this book explores a lot of those areas. The book doesn't tell you what to do--just makes you aware of a number of different issues that can come up and describes some of the things that other people have done in those situations.",1

He also wrote How to Stop Worrying and Start Living (1948), Lincoln the Unknown (1932), and several other books.",['Dale Carnegie'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=h_lyEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=h_lyEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=How+to+Stop+Worrying+and+Start+Living&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,DigiCat,2022-05-17,http://books.google.com/books?id=h_lyEAAAQBAJ&dq=How+to+Stop+Worrying+and+Start+Living&hl=&source=gbs_api,"['Body, Mind & Spirit']",1012.0,B000MOPRG6,,A2VIUQPS0OAN2A,Claire,96/97,5.0,1226361600,The Book is Like Compound-W for Worry Warts,"Dale Carnegie wrote some great books back in the 30's and 40's, and this book is one of them- Carnegie fans won't be disappointed.The writing style is classic Carnegie. To put it simply, the guy just writes like he talks. This makes for a very friendly and easy to understand book, rather like a good friend giving you a piece of advice.And a lot of advice he gives. The book is divided up into ten sections, each one tackling some aspect of worrying. I could give you a rundown of the topics, but you don't really need me to repeat the table on contents to decide if you want to read the book. Rather, let me just say that book covers just about every major ""worry issue"" that might be causing a troubled mind, such as your work, your finances, other people's criticisms- and them some.While there are no earth-shattering, never-before-seen tips in the book, I wouldn't hesitate for a second to recommend it to anyone who is looking to ease their mind a bit. That's because it does a GREAT job of conveying simple wisdom that really make you think good and hard about why you're worrying and if those things are really worth worrying about at all.In short, its a bestseller because it makes a lot of sense and its advice can do a lot to re-frame your thinking about things. And if you can re-frame your thinking, well, you've about found the best ""Compound-W"" for worry warts.

I had read the reviews and looked closer at the item and ""inside the book"". Just wanted others to be aware that this is not a book with Sesame Street Characters in it. From a previous reviewer years ago it's apparent that Sesame was involved then. Anyway....This book is excellent! It is 544 pages which are all VERY colorful with lively characters and good detailed objects. My 2 year old has had no trouble identifying what the illustrator is displaying in each picture. All pages are perforated to pull out. My only gripe is that the publisher should have put more thought into the ordering of the pages and activities. For example - if we are working on the color RED today, the book was printed so that the color Red starts on the back page of another color and continues to the following page. So you can never tear out just one page per color for your child to work on.I love the Introduction section for the parents on what to expect from your 3 yr old and another page for age 4. There is also a personal checklist where you can record the dates your child mastered certain developmental skills (basic skills, reading readiness skills, mathematics skills, fine (small) motor skills and gross (large) motor skills).From the Table of Contents page...Basic Concepts and Skills (Colors, Shapes, Sizes, Opposites, Go-Togethers, Same and Different)Writing Readiness (Tracing dotted lines...

First, Next, Last, Ordinal Numbers, One to One Correspondence, More and Fewer, Patterns)Appendix (Manuscript Alphabet & Teaching Skills)My 2 year old is loving this book!

The Most Commonly Asked Questions About 'A Course in Miracles',"The 72 questions are arranged by topics including Jesus, the metaphysics, application, form, language, and the curriculum of A Course in Miracles.","['Gloria Wapnick', 'Kenneth Wapnick']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uQx2AAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=uQx2AAAACAAJ&dq=The+Most+Commonly+Asked+Questions+About+%27A+Course+in+Miracles%27&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Foundation for a Course in,1995,http://books.google.com/books?id=uQx2AAAACAAJ&dq=The+Most+Commonly+Asked+Questions+About+%27A+Course+in+Miracles%27&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],,0933291213,8.0,A1D6DFC3AGV3JZ,Andrew Parodi,96/97,5.0,1019347200,Indispensable for Course students,"""A Course In Miracles"" is founded on the definition of God as a formless, timeless, presence of abstract love that ultimately doesn't even know that we exist as individuals. Further, the Course says the entire physical world is an illusion that never happened. Can you fully understand or grasp this? Can I? No. And the Course says it's better not to try, and it refers to such attempts as ""senseless musings."" Rather, the Course is aimed at our experience here in this world that, though ultimately illusory, is the classroom in which we learn the lessons of forgiveness.Based on such an impossible-to-grasp theory, it goes without saying that this Course is not always easy to understand. This is not a Course for everyone (""There are many paths, and they all lead to God in the end""). But for those who believe it is the path for them, this book will make the path understandable. This book is all in question and answer format, with no additional commentary by the authors. The book does close, however, with a mission statement for the Foundation for A Course In Miracles, founded by the two authors of this book, as well as a catalogue of products from the Foundation.Seventy-two questions are answered, and they are divided into five chapters:CHAPTER 1: ""The Nature of Heaven"" - In this chapter the abstract philosophy of the Course is addressed, such as Course theory that God did not create and in fact does not even know about the physical world. Is this the same God of the Bible? Why are masculine terms exclusively used in the Course? These questions, ten in all, are answered in this chapter.CHAPTER 2: ""The Nature of the Separation"" - In this chapter, in 12 questions and answers, the theory of the separation is addressed. The ""separation"" is the Course theory that all the problems in the world are really only one problem: the separation from God. What's more, the separation never occurred in reality. Well then why am I suffering in a world of pain? If God didn't create the world, who did? What is the Course's view of time? What does the Course mean when it says there is no death? These questions, among others, are answered.CHAPTER 3: ""Application and Practice of 'A Course In Miracles'"" - In 24 questions and answers, we go beyond the abstract theory of the Course and focus on our physical lives in this world. Though this world, as taught in A Course In Miracles, is ultimately illusory, it is by living in this world that we learn the lessons we are meant to learn. Does the Course have a code of ethics and morality? Are babies born innocent? Can you be a student of the Course and still serve on a jury, be a doctor, lawyer, etc.? If this is all a dream, does that mean the abuse I suffered as a child should be denied or ignored? If this world and the body are illusory, does that mean it is wrong to enjoy them? These and other questions are answered.CHAPTER 4: ""Jesus"" - Six of the most commonly asked questions about Jesus&#65533; role in the Course are answered here. Is this the same Jesus as the Jesus of the Bible? Where in the Course does it say that Jesus is the author? Why does Jesus say in the Course that I should forgive him? You'll find the answers here.CHAPTER 5: ""The Curriculum of 'A Course In Miracles'"" - Here the way in which the Course should be studied is addressed. Should a student start with the Text, the Workbook, or the Manual for Teachers? What should one say to a friend or family member about the Course? Should children study the Course? Should I practice the Course in seclusion without worldly distractions? Should students of the Course only go to therapists familiar with the Course? Seventeen questions in all are answered in this chapter.This book certainly is not intended for cover-to-cover reading. I consider this more of a reference book, perfect for occasional ""check ups"" on Course comprehension. Often, I use this book just for meditations. And, I must admit, some of the answers, particularly the more abstract ones dealing with the illusory nature of the world and time, as well as the concept of their being no right or wrong, can be quite overwhelming - even after five years of studying the Course.This isn't an easy Course, and it wasn't intended to be. But this book makes it a little more understandable. Of course, when the ego finally lets go the student will finally see how simple it really is (...still waiting for that to happen).",1

THE ESCOFFIER COOK BOOK: A GUIDE TO THE FINE ART OF COOKERY,An American adaptation of a standard guide to the French culinary arts,['Auguste Escoffier'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OO7NVyLhiSYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=OO7NVyLhiSYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=THE+ESCOFFIER+COOK+BOOK:+A+GUIDE+TO+THE+FINE+ART+OF+COOKERY&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Clarkson Potter,1976,http://books.google.com/books?id=OO7NVyLhiSYC&dq=THE+ESCOFFIER+COOK+BOOK:+A+GUIDE+TO+THE+FINE+ART+OF+COOKERY&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Cooking'],5.0,B000QAWT7G,,AU1VEF29CUKX,Charlene Vickers,96/97,4.0,1123977600,"Fascinating to read, but not a ""cookbook"" in the modern sense","""The Escoffier Cookbook"" is a heavily abridged American version of Auguste Escoffier's 1903 book ""Guide Culinaire"". It is a fascinating look at the art of professional European cookery at the beginning of the 20th century.However, to appreciate this book fully, it's important to understand exactly who it was written for. Escoffier's original guide was never for a second intended for the home cook. Escoffier was a pioneer with respect to the education of professional chefs, and originally wrote this book for the use of those working in grand houses, in hotels, on ocean liners, and in restaurants who might not have had access to contemporary recipes. Accordingly, the original book does not attempt to teach basic cooking or food preparation techniques. The American translation does include some details on cooking techniques and utensils unfamiliar to the average American chef (such as poeleing, worth the cost of the book alone, and the old French form of braising), but even in the translation it is assumed that the reader is a trained, experienced chef.The recipes themselves are clear and simple to follow, but represent only a small subset of French cooking of the early 20th century. An earlier reviewer mentioned that there was no recipe for onion soup; this is true, but it should be understood that onion soup would never have been accepted by the class of restaurant patron Escoffier cooked for. Much of what has arrived on this side of the Atlantic as ""French cooking"" - dishes such as pot-au-feu, onion soup, and steak frites - is distinctly middle-class, and consequently would have been rejected by the clientele of quality restaurants of the time as being unspeakably boorish. Escoffier personally enjoyed bourgeois cooking, but as an astute, intelligent businessman he provided the haute cuisine his clients demanded.One interesting difference between modern cooking and the cooking featured in this book is that Escoffier uses few spices, and indeed declaims on the foolishness of using large amounts of spices in meat dishes. This appears bizarre from our vantage point, but Escoffier had sound economic reasons for his proscriptions. Most diners of the time grew up in the days before refrigeration, when old deteriorating meat was heavily spiced to make it palatable. Fresh, unspiced meat was a sign of the highest quality. The association between strong spices and poor quality was powerful enough to survive long into the 20th century, as any reader of a 1950s American cookbook can attest.As for the recipes themselves, I doubt that many of them could be prepared by the North American home cook. Most of us cannot afford (if we can even find) foie gras, truffles, or capons, and few have espagnole sauce or fish fumet available at all times. However, many recipes can be adapted for the modern cook - using cepes or porcini mushrooms for truffles, for instance - and those that can be prepared really are delicious.",1

Henderson,96/97,4.0,1121731200,"Some great features to get your started, but needs a few improvements","My wife and I picked up this book in the pet store along with a 29-gallon starter kit. It might have been better to read the book first, but I lucked out in that there was nothing really wrong with my kit (All-Glass kit with Tetra components). I like the For Dummies books, and looked through the Dummies book, but this one got me with its colorful photos, but is written in very much the same style as Dummies: Cartoons beginning the chapters, call-outs in the margins, friendly writing style, etc.If you're a raw beginner with aquaria, I don't know what you could need that this book doesn't cover. I think the most valuable unique feature is the last chapter which includes a dozen or so expertly predesigned stocking schemes. Compatible fish are chosen, and the numbers given for your size tank (29- or 50- gallon) to ensure success. We are following the Asian biotope with White Clouds, Rasboras, Gold Barbs and Dwarf Gouramis.Probably the most annoying thing about the book is that the photos of the fish are scattered throughout the book. It is nice in that while you are reading on more mundane topics, there's a fish photo to remind you of your results. I can see the advantage of this, but when you want to see what a Dwarf Gourami looks like, you have to search through the book. The index lists the fish, but does not reference the photographs! A separate index of the photos would be nice, or, at the minimum, list the photos in the regular index.The author strongly suggests a 50- or 55-gallon tank to begin with. This is not a bad recommendation. But he realizes that that's not practical for all households. A 29 gallon is his second choice. The things he preaches are regular water changes, no overfeeding and not overpopulating the tank.Mr. Boruchowitz suggests placing the tank near a floor drain and where a hose easily reaches. I suspect that this is not possible for most people who want an aquarium, like us, to add ambience to your living area. To meet his suggestions, we'd be putting the tank outside on the patio or on the bathroom sink! Therein lies the main disadvantage of a larger tank - water changes need to be done with buckets.Although he does tell you the correct pronunciation of ""cichlid,"" I wish he had discussed other pronunciations so you don't feel like a fool in the fish store. (Gouramis: Gore-A-meez or GORE-a-miss?). A half page on Latin pronunciation would have been a cool addition.There seems to be a wide range of recommendations on what to do while cycling the tank. Some experts recommend 10-15% weekly water changes while cycling or not. They argue that letting the ammonia level rise encourages the development of the nitrifying bacteria (this is a good thing - we're trying to do this) and there is little unusual you need to do. At the other end of the spectrum are those who do large and frequent water water changes while cycling to keep the ammonia levels down for the benefit of the fish, and argue that the bacteria will develop fine regardless. Mr. Boruchowitz falls very much in the latter camp, also encouraging frequent water testing while cycling. I guess my point is to be aware that there's a range of opinions on this topic, and you may find that you can be sucessful with less work than presented. (My expert aquarist coworker told me to not bother testing and don't do anything heroic with water changes.)Other reviewers complained that the author did not focus much on the fish. There are 1000-plus-page books on freshwater aquarium fish, and I believe that this is outside the scope of this book. There is enough discussion of fish to make you avoid problems, and if you follow the suggested stocking schemes, you should be successful. This book is addressed to beginners. Once you're successful with a scheme in this book, you can spend a lifetime researching other fish to keep.This book also explodes many misconceptions, like that fish only grow to fit the size of the tank, (They grow until the tank is too small to support them, and they die!) and that you must have an algae eater in the tank (the problem is that people use an algae-eater as an excuse to omit proper maintenance, or don't consider its load on the tank).I HIGHLY recommend this book to someone starting with an aquarium for the first time (and would suggest getting the book first, but when we decided to get an aquarium, we were too excited not to buy the whole outfit!). I only did not give it five stars because there's room for improvement, especially in indexing the fish photos.",1
The Escoffier Cook Book: A Guide to the Fine Art of Cookery,An American adaptation of a standard guide to the French culinary arts,['Auguste Escoffier'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OO7NVyLhiSYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=OO7NVyLhiSYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Escoffier+Cook+Book:+A+Guide+to+the+Fine+Art+of+Cookery&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Clarkson Potter,1976,http://books.google.com/books?id=OO7NVyLhiSYC&dq=The+Escoffier+Cook+Book:+A+Guide+to+the+Fine+Art+of+Cookery&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Cooking'],5.0,B000H5PCPQ,,AU1VEF29CUKX,Charlene Vickers,96/97,4.0,1123977600,"Fascinating to read, but not a ""cookbook"" in the modern sense","""The Escoffier Cookbook"" is a heavily abridged American version of Auguste Escoffier's 1903 book ""Guide Culinaire"". It is a fascinating look at the art of professional European cookery at the beginning of the 20th century.However, to appreciate this book fully, it's important to understand exactly who it was written for. Escoffier's original guide was never for a second intended for the home cook. Escoffier was a pioneer with respect to the education of professional chefs, and originally wrote this book for the use of those working in grand houses, in hotels, on ocean liners, and in restaurants who might not have had access to contemporary recipes. Accordingly, the original book does not attempt to teach basic cooking or food preparation techniques. The American translation does include some details on cooking techniques and utensils unfamiliar to the average American chef (such as poeleing, worth the cost of the book alone, and the old French form of braising), but even in the translation it is assumed that the reader is a trained, experienced chef.The recipes themselves are clear and simple to follow, but represent only a small subset of French cooking of the early 20th century. An earlier reviewer mentioned that there was no recipe for onion soup; this is true, but it should be understood that onion soup would never have been accepted by the class of restaurant patron Escoffier cooked for. Much of what has arrived on this side of the Atlantic as ""French cooking"" - dishes such as pot-au-feu, onion soup, and steak frites - is distinctly middle-class, and consequently would have been rejected by the clientele of quality restaurants of the time as being unspeakably boorish. Escoffier personally enjoyed bourgeois cooking, but as an astute, intelligent businessman he provided the haute cuisine his clients demanded.One interesting difference between modern cooking and the cooking featured in this book is that Escoffier uses few spices, and indeed declaims on the foolishness of using large amounts of spices in meat dishes. This appears bizarre from our vantage point, but Escoffier had sound economic reasons for his proscriptions. Most diners of the time grew up in the days before refrigeration, when old deteriorating meat was heavily spiced to make it palatable. Fresh, unspiced meat was a sign of the highest quality. The association between strong spices and poor quality was powerful enough to survive long into the 20th century, as any reader of a 1950s American cookbook can attest.As for the recipes themselves, I doubt that many of them could be prepared by the North American home cook. Most of us cannot afford (if we can even find) foie gras, truffles, or capons, and few have espagnole sauce or fish fumet available at all times. However, many recipes can be adapted for the modern cook - using cepes or porcini mushrooms for truffles, for instance - and those that can be prepared really are delicious.",1

"Brokenburn: The Journal of Kate Stone, 1861-1868","This journal records the Civil War experiences of a sensitive, well-educated, young southern woman. Kate Stone was twenty when the war began, living with her widowed mother, five brothers, and younger sister at Brokenburn, their plantation home in northeastern Louisiana. When Grant moved against Vicksburg, the family fled before the invading armies, eventually found refuge in Texas, and finally returned to a devastated home. Kate began her journal in May, 1861, and made regular entries up to November, 1865. She included briefer sketches in 1867 and 1868. In chronicling her everyday activities, Kate reveals much about a way of life that is no more: books read, plantation management and crops, maintaining slaves in the antebellum period, the attitude and conduct of slaves during the war, the fate of refugees, and civilian morale.

She is an admixture of a great privilege, passionate beliefs, lover of literature, keen social observations and amazing fortitude. Her Civil War was dangerous, turbulent and life changing.Brokenburn was a large plantation containing over 150 slaves in Madison Parish, LA. From 1862 on, it was in the center of the Union Army's fierce assault to gain control of the Mississippi River and divide the Confederacy in half. Plantations were commandeered and slaves were encouraged to revolt. The civilian population was helpless before the demands of military control. Madison Parish had a population of approximately 9,000 of whom 7,000 were slaves. After 1861, the Parish was emptied of able-bodied white men, most of whom had been sent to far-off Virginia and Tennessee, leaving none to protect the civilians.In 1861, Kate was 20 years old, her immediate future being beaus, courtship, and a gay social life before she settled down to become a proper southern matron. She was unsure whether this route was ideal, as she remarked, ""women grew significantly uglier in wedlock and ignored and abandoned their former female friends."" This comfortable world was turned upside down, never to reappear again. With great enthusiasm and some trepidation, she watched her three older brothers go off to war. Her widowed mother made it clear that 14-year-old James was now in charge of the running of the plantation and the protection of the rest of the family. I was amazed at the serene assumption that a young teenager was thrust in this role, but it seems that was the custom of the times. If you had to grow up fast, you did. Yellow fever was a constant in the area, and longevity was not a norm. Both Generals Grant and Lee wanted their troops out of these areas during ""the seasons of pestilence."" This was not to be, and both armies suffered devastating losses to disease. Kate treated the ""fever season"" as a fact of life, and planned around it with remarkable briskness.By 1862, the Stone family was desperate. The Federal leadership demanded that they stay on their property; yet there were serious slave insurrections that threatened the lives of the plantation holders. Those slaves who were not hostile were running off, and there was no labor to farm the crops. Many southerners could not believe that their ""loyal"" slaves would run away. Kate was not among them, saying, ""If I were in their place, I'd do the same."" She was by no means sympathetic, just practical.The family finally escaped through the bayous in a rickety canoe with nothing, not even underwear, and finally made it across the border into Texas. They were refugees along with many other prominent Louisiana families. Kate was convinced they had arrived at ""a dark corner of the Confederacy."" Upon noting the barefoot but hoop skirted frontier ladies, she sniffed ""there must be something in the air of Texas fatal to beauty.""Kate agonized over the increasingly bad war news and was devastated by Lee's surrender. Kate is one of the most vivid, perceptive diarists of the Civil War. Her diary is one of social history, a time of calamitous change and invaluable for understanding this crucial time in American history. Kate is a natural writer and observer.

The close-up photos really illustrate what the stitches should and shouldn't look like. Her book also helps you understand how the machine works, which in turn allows you to master your machine (rather than merely follow the settings in your manual). She offers many, many tips and how-tos, and her samples are inspirational. I have noticed several small mistakes, such as a mismatch of needle sizes (she says 80/14 and 90/16 rather than 80/12 and 90/14, and at least one of her rolled hem close-ups is mislabeled.) Don't let that stop you from purchasing this book however.I teach serger classes to new serger owners and much of what I discuss comes from this book. I also have the &quot;Serger Secrets&quot; book.

The problem with Stossel's work is that he does not examine the industry line. He only scrutinises arguments in favour of energy conservation, emissions reduction and responsible stewardship.Why am I so suspicious? Well, I once worked for a firm that was paid thousands of dollars to promote Stossel's television specials and to publicly avow the accuracy of his reporting.Who paid us? ABC? Nope. Stossel's own people? Again, no. We were paid by a consortium of major chemical manufacturers to tout Stossel's line as gospel truth - despite the fact that it was a one-sided account of controversial issues, including but not limited to climate change.Our task was to phone journalists, columnists and grass-roots organisations around the country and make sure they were watching Stossel and covering his ""findings"" in local media.

I am not trying to criticize Still's beliefs, but he clearly comes from the religious tradition that believes that any sort of behavior that does not agree with his theology 100% is &quot;satanist&quot;. In fact he condemns his subject matter as &quot;satanist&quot; or &quot;satanism&quot; so many times that the judgement loses its force very quickly. Still also comes from the branch of Christianity that feels that all persons or ideas that do not comply with those fundamental beliefs to the letter are part of a vast conspiracy seeking to crush Christian beliefs. Once again, Still's personal beliefs are his right, but he has such a clear contempt for his subject matter that he is completely unable to investigate it in any useful fashion.

1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus,"Hoe de wereld zich ontwikkelde na de ontdekking van Amerika De reizen van Columbus vormden het begin van een bijzondere uitwisseling van flora en fauna tussen Eurazië en Noord- en Zuid-Amerika.

Een minder welkome uitwisseling was uiteraard die van insecten, bacteriën en virussen. Charles Mann laat zien dat deze zogeheten Columbian Exchange heeft gezorgd voor de opkomst van Europa, de ondergang van het Chinese keizerrijk en de verstoring van de ecologie in Afrika. Met 1493 heeft bestsellerauteur Charles Mann de belangrijkste biologische gebeurtenis sinds het uitsterven van de dinosauriërs onder de aandacht van een groot publiek weten te brengen.

In addition to the fact that the first quarter or so of this book focuses on post-contact life in the Americas rather than life prior to significant European contact, it chooses a clear socio-political trajectory, omitting points of intellectual decent.

Rather than stating that human migration into the Americas started at the point he suggestss, it would have been more accurate and interesting to discuss the various models put forward by archaeologists. Multiple migrations, for example. Or new evidence suggesting that the people we think of as Native Americans (regardless of national/tribal affiliation) may have out-competed or even killed of a biologically dissimilar population that had made the migration before them.

In love I say that which will most probably offend: This is not a book to be educated on Christianity.Donald Miller's relateable story is personal with all the doubts and struggles of Christians, but here is the word of warning to believers and unbelievers alike: his Christian beliefs are conclusions of human experience, and not derived from the foundation of Christianity -- the Bible.The prime example of this statement is that it takes him until the last five pages of the book (236 of 242) to realize maybe he should actually read the Bible, as in -- all of it!As Christian author and speaker, Miller does irresponsible disservice to unbelievers who might be curious about Christianity and Christians who may read the book to deepen their faith. Misleading them to glorify and romanticize fallen man's experience and worldly wisdom to determine Christian belief for 235 pages before introducing the possibility that maybe a Christian should read the Bible.My recommendation instead of this book? The Bible. You can buy a good copy for seven bucks and if you can understand Blue Like Jazz you'll have no trouble reading it in a year. Read it from Genesis to Revelations. Take notes, ask questions and pray that God will help you know him. Scrub out all the preconceived notions of Jesus, hypocrite Christians and televangelists and do the hard work -- read the Bible.

This book talks about exercising, and yes, exercising along with eating a low calorie diet will help you lose weight. This is why people are successful at losing weight on this program (they burn calories exercising while cutting back on calories by eliminating carbs). Look at the reviews and see the people who have said they're successful. It's people who also follow a low-carb diet along with the program. Low-carb diets work intially but they are not sustainable long-term. They just aren't. The lethargic effect of such a diet always catches up to you, and eventually you eat carbs once again, and you guessed it, the weight comes back on.The authors of this book advocate low-carb dieting, and they also advocate minimal exercise, and no cardiovascular exercise. This type of quick-fix, short-term thinking is never successful for people who are in it for the long haul, and want to improve their overall health. If you want to drop weight quick and not worry about long-term effects then this is the book for you. If you are serious about your health, this is not the type of book you should be reading.",1
On Beauty,"Aquinas on Beauty explores the nature and role of beauty in the thought of Thomas Aquinas.

The book also highlights the tight connection in Aquinas’s thought between aesthetics and ethics, and illustrates how Aquinas preserves what is best about aesthetic traditions preceding him, and anticipates what is best about aesthetic traditions that would follow, marrying objective and subjective aesthetic intuitions and charting a kind of via media between the common extremes.",['Christopher Scott Sevier'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=isKlBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=isKlBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA4&dq=On+Beauty&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Lexington Books,2015-02-12,http://books.google.nl/books?id=isKlBwAAQBAJ&dq=On+Beauty&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Philosophy'],,B000N76XWY,,A1SYLII0808HD6,M.

Malkmus that was allegedly based on Scripture verses from the Bible called The Hallelujah Diet.My first exposure to this holy diet plan was when the former minister of music at my church lost a significant amount of weight on it several years back. He was already a big man at 6'7"" tall, but The Hallelujah Diet helped him trim down by an incredible 75 pounds. The results of this way of eating for him were just undeniable and he was one of the strongest proponents for this way of eating you'll ever meet. But there's more to share about what happened next for him in just a moment.Malkmus is well-known within Christian circles for his frequent appearances on radio and television and in publishing a health newsletter that is read by hundreds of thousands of people each month. In addition, he travels all around the country talking about health and nutrition in seminars held mostly in churches and local venues.His message: God ordained the way we should eat and it includes consuming living and organic foods, implementing better lifestyle choices, and getting our lives in accordance with what the Lord wants for us.This all sounds good on the surface and certainly Malkmus is a strong believer in the Lord and in the health principles he is teaching people about their diet. But that ""optimal health you were meant to have"" according to Malkmus is predicated on eating lots and lots of living and organic foods which in and of itself is not a bad thing. However, when it is to the exclusion of foods such as meat (described as ""dead animal products"" which Malkmus believes ""is more harmful to our health"" than any other food) and other ""deadly"" foods, Malkmus reveals that his motive is less spiritual than it is in promoting veganism and the vegetarian lifestyle.With that said, though, I give credence to Malkmus for acknowledging the harmful effects of excessive preservatives in foods, white sugar (which he says ""contributes to an obese society, contributing to epidemic rates of heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, and a long list of emotional problems""), prescription medications, white flour (which makes ""the most wonderful paste""), and caffeine. That is why Malmus highly recommends people eat more raw foods to have their bodies work the way God intended.Sprinkled throughout the book are various success stories from people who have been on The Hallelujah Diet in an effort to legitimize that it really is working for real people. I'm sure it is, but the jury is out on the so-called 85:15 rule, where 85 percent of food consumed should be raw and a mere 15 percent is cooked foods.Wanna see what you get to eat in a typical day on The Hallelujah Diet? Try this on for size.BREAKFAST: One serving of BarleyMax powder to cleanse the system.MID-MORNING SNACK: 8-oz glass of vegetable juice with flax seed.LUNCH: More BarleyMax with raw veggies and fruit.MID-AFTERNOON SNACK: 8-oz glass of vegetable juice with trail mix.DINNER: Another BarleyMax serving with non-head lettuce and pasta.DESSERT: Juicy fresh fruit or organic apple juice.EVENING SNACK: Homemade organic recipes from the book.Doesn't this just sound so yummy to your tummy? NOT!While I can certainly appreciate a pastor trying to help people eat better than they ever have before to preserve the temple of the Holy Spirit which is our bodies, I cannot for the life of me understand how Malkmus believes his nutritional approach is the one and only way that God would have people to lose weight and get healthy. With all due respect to my fellow brother in Christ, he is just plain wrong in his conclusions about weight loss and diet for ALL people. There is no one God-endorsed diet plan out there and anyone who tells you otherwise is lying.When I weighed 410 pounds just two years ago, there is no way I could have ever been able to do The Hallelujah Diet because it was more of what I had heard my entire life about getting my weight under control -- eat better, stop eating junk food, move your body, YADDA YADDA YADDA! Those statements ring so hollow and I heard them again and again as I read The Hallelujah Diet book.But now that I found a healthy way to eat and control my weight through the incredibly healthy low-carb lifestyle, my life has been radically changed for the better -- over 180 pounds gone forever! Is God mad at me for losing weight and keeping it off this way, Rev. Malkmus? I sure don't think so. He is probably happy to see me finally find a way to control my cravings, enjoy the foods that He created for me to eat, and now serving as someone who can inspire and encourage others who need to lose weight, too.Remember that minister of music I told you about who had lost weight being an enthusiastic follower of The Hallelujah Diet. Well, apparently he got tired of having to avoid social events at church where there was food that was totally off-limits to him for his diet. Not only has he gained back all of that weight he lost, but he now weighs more than he did before he went on the diet. It's sad to see that happen to this great man of God, but unfortunately it was predictable in my opinion.Some people can only keep up that way of eating for a short period of time before they go completely nuts! While Malkmus believes in his diet, I don't think there's anything shameful about a Christian choosing to follow another diet plan instead. Perhaps people who have tried and failed on The Hallelujah Diet should try the low-carb lifestyle instead. I know that will be a hard transition, especially since Malkmus often references such radical vegetarian activists such as Dr. Joel Fuhrman, T. Colin Campbell from The China Study, and other various anti-dairy, anti-meat web sites in the appendix to his book. But you can do it and God will help you just as He helped me.Permanent weight loss is definitely within your grasp and I pray that God will reveal to you what will work best for your body. After you lose the weight for good you can shout HALLELUJAH for the blessings that God has bestowed upon you for lasting weight loss and improved health like you've never seen before. It CAN happen if you believe that God can still perform miracles -- he did it for me thanks to livin' la vida low-carb and I'll never be the same again! And he'll MAKE IT HAPPEN for you as well.",1
"The Truth about Hillary (Clinton): What She Knew, When She Knew It, and How Far She'll Go to Become President","Hillary Rodham Clinton is the most polarizing figure in American politics. Love her or hate her, everyone has a strong opinion about the former first lady turned senator who is almost certainly going to run for president in 2008. Despite more than a dozen years in the national spotlight and more than a dozen unauthorized books about her, she has managed to keep many secrets from the public especially about her turbulent marriage and its impact on her career. There have been plenty of rumors about what Hillary and Bill Clinton did behind closed doors, but never a definitive book that exposes the truth. Bestselling author Edward Klein draws on rare access to inside sources to reveal what Hillary knew and when she knew it during her years as first lady, especially during her husband’s impeachment. Klein’s book, embargoed until publication, will break news about the choices and calculations she has made over the years. It will also prove that she lied to America in her bestselling autobiography Living History. When she was just a little girl, Hillary Rodham dreamed of becoming the first female president, and her lifelong dream is almost within reach. But just as the swift boat veterans convinced millions of voters that John Kerry lacked the character to be president, Klein’s book will influence everyone who is sizing up the character of Hillary Clinton.",['Edward Klein'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wTluOHsLZZAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=wTluOHsLZZAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Truth+about+Hillary+(Clinton):+What+She+Knew,+When+She+Knew+It,+and+How+Far+She%27ll+Go+to+Become+President&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Penguin,2005-06-21,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wTluOHsLZZAC&source=gbs_api,['Political Science'],1.0,1419354795,26.99,ADGFYRHHUJEBW,Charles Lawrence,96/132,5.0,1119225600,Have you read the book?,"Why are there already ""reviews"" or even low (or high - I had to select one to post this question) stars, if the book has not even come out?

Mowat is, no doubt, an excellent naturalist, and many of the adventures described in the book are very entertaining. However, I am very disturbed that, although the author is ready to defend HIS pets with his shotgun against other animals, he pretty much gave his own animals not just free rein but also encouragement to kill the pets of others. Mutt the dog is deliberately set on a woman's cats, and the &quot;secret cemetery&quot; of neighborhood cats filled by his pet owl is described with almost pride.Also disturbing to me is the author's attitude toward women. Any complaining woman is described as &quot;spinsterish.&quot; The &quot;Cat Lady&quot; whose cats the author set his dog on to attack and kill was described as harboring &quot;yearning hope&quot; for a male intruder to come and presumably do things to her that I don't want to refer to in a review that children may read -- the implication is pretty strong, with a reference also to the Sabine women.I may get flamed for this review, but I feel that these are very poor attitudes to be subtly or unsubtly conveying to children.

In other words, I think I'm a good deal more qualified to comment on family life than is Ms. Hewlett. I will be honest: Although we both hold masters' degrees, my wife makes twice the income I do, and when we were younger, we split shifts to make BOTH our careers work and enjoy parenting. My wife and I have an income well over six figures, which certainly puts us in Hewlett's ""high-acheiving"" category. Yet, we could only find a few ""caricatures"" (since that's exactly what they are) in this book that resembled anyone we knew. We DO have a daughter struggling with infertility--who married at 22, has two advanced degrees, and is 29 and married to an equally accomplished man. Her infertility obviously isn't age-related. (I was so terrified she'd find this book that I returned it to the bookstore.) Nor do I think that men are somehow dumping ""accomplished"" women in droves. In my professional life as a public interest lawyer, I knew few men who were not married to women who were at least their intellectual equals. Some of them, it's true, did have difficulties having children and careers simultaneously, along with their wives. Was it that they and their spouses ""put themselves first?"" No--it's a much simpler reason, and as a former economist, Hewlett is a fool for not mentioning it: It's the economy. While the ""simple living"" movement made a nice dent in this, the fact is that materialistic tomes emnating from places like Manhattan make it difficult for couples to survive on one income. At one point Hewlett writes that she didn't have to ""maximize her earnings"" during the several cutting-edge infertility she went through at 51. Maximize? Uh, right.There's a solution to this--it's not scaring little girls into having babies at 19, nor whipping ""career women"" who have to wait. It has more to do with raising wages, affordable housing, marital stability, better health care (much infertility is caused by untreated STDs), and teaching people about when it's realistic to be parents (I wasn't at 20, some aren't at 35, and some aren't ever, especially if the baby is just another ""accomplishment."" My mother had six children, spoke only Spanish, and could not read or write in any language. She had her last child at 49--not by choice, either. My father was no more educated, nor did he make a ""living wage"" for eight people. It bothers me that as I get ready to leave this earth, we haven't come much further than Brownsville, Texas in the 1950s. In Hewlett's view, a woman must have an accomplished husband, children, and high-track career. My mother had few choices--now it appears that my daughters don't, either. What a waste, to promulgate this do-as-I-do ""feminism.""",1
Warriors of God : Richard the Lionheart and Saladin in the Third Crusade,"Acclaimed author James Reston, Jr.'s Warriors of God is the rich and engaging account of the Third Crusade (1187-1192), a conflict that would shape world history for centuries and which can still be felt in the Middle East and throughout the world today. James Reston, Jr. offers a gripping narrative of the epic battle that left Jerusalem in Muslim hands until the twentieth century, bringing an objective perspective to the gallantry, greed, and religious fervor that fueled the bloody clash between Christians and Muslims. As he recounts this rousing story, Reston brings to life the two legendary figures who led their armies against each other. He offers compelling portraits of Saladin, the wise and highly cultured leader who created a united empire, and Richard the Lionheart, the romantic personification of chivalry who emerges here in his full complexity and contradictions. From its riveting scenes of blood-soaked battles to its pageant of fascinating, larger-than-life characters, Warriors of God is essential history, history that helps us understand today's world.","['James Reston, Jr.']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=n68ZQKYAj58C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=n68ZQKYAj58C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Warriors+of+God+:+Richard+the+Lionheart+and+Saladin+in+the+Third+Crusade&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Anchor,2007-12-18,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=n68ZQKYAj58C&source=gbs_api,['History'],13.0,B000234N58,,A13W3BD75G5S1B,"Suzanne Cross ""Bibliophilos""",96/123,2.0,1003363200,A Surprising Disappointment,"I've known generally about Richard I, Saladin, and the Third Crusade for years, and thought this book would fill in the gaps by focusing on this extraordinary adventure and its two legendary protagonists. Up to a point, it was informative, although Mr. Reston's flip and jazzy tone began to jar upon me fairly early on. I suppose he's trying to make history &quot;interesting&quot; - but this period is, without having to be stylistically cute.What really bothers me about this book is that it purports to tell both sides of the story - the Crusaders who thought they were &quot;saving&quot; the Holy Land, the Muslims who believed equally passionately that they must defend it - and manages, instead, to portray this marvelously complicated piece of history as a black-and-white case of good vs. evil. And quite clearly, the European Crusaders are the bad guys, Saladin and the Arabs the good guys. That's a valid point of view - heaven knows, there are (sadly) a lot of books which try this simplistic approach the other way around - but this book is attempting to present itself as history. In any history, when the author's own private feelings and agenda are so clearly displayed that the facts become twisted, you haven't got history - you've got an editorial. I not only cannot recommend this book, I'm really irritated with it and with those that don't see that Reston is not being objective one little bit.To illustrate the point, let me contrast some descriptive words and phrases Mr. Reston uses repeatedly to describe the two sides. I got fascinated at what he was doing and started jotting them down mid-way through the book.Europeans: Strutted, boasted, ferocious, dispute, confused, greedily, besotted, inept, hypocritical, homosexual, cunning, squabbles about money, preposterous greed, stubborness, slaughtered, vainglory, whining, atrocious, bruality.Arabs: Devout, generosity, serenely, calm, purity of motives, peaceful, bravery, vigilance, estimable, distinguished, courageously, stouthearted, dignity, pride, valor, magnificence.PUH-LEEZE. I personally find it horrible to read about what passed for Christianity during the Crusades. I've always thought Saladin was a remarkable and fascinating leader and never much cared for Richard Lion Heart. But to turn Richard I into nothing more than a blustering, brutal homosexual braggart (Reston dwells on his supposed sexuality as established fact again and again) while Saladin's behavior is ever learned, tolerant and serene, just insults my intelligence. Life is never that simple and history is never that two-dimensional.Read this book for the facts of the Crusade and for its many fascinating quotations from the Koran, and try to ignore the agenda - but it isn't easy.",0

Lamoreaux,96/122,1.0,1135641600,Deliberately misleading,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. This book was purchased as a gift for me, and I looked forward to reading it. From the beginning, I was disappointed by the tone of the book, which casts a subtle negative tone on the life of someone who I revere greatly. As I researched some of Ellis' sources, I found that in several parts of his book, he stated items as facts that were completely false.Ellis, following a popular trend of today, insinuates that George Washington was in love with his friend's wife, Sally Fairfax, and that he felt passionately in love with her throughout his life.Ellis admits that all we do know is based primarily on three letters Washington wrote to Sally (Fairfax). The last letter he cites was one Washington wrote near the end of his life. Mr. Ellis states that ""in this letter, he confessed to an elderly Sally that she had been the passion of his youth, that he had never been able to forget her, 'nor been able to eradicate from my mind those happy moments, the happiest in my life, which have enjoyed in your company.""I decided to research his references, and look up the text of Washington's letter on the Library of Congress website. They have actual images of all of the original letters of George Washington. What I found relieved me greatly and set my mind at ease. It also made me feel disgusted than an author who claims to accurately represent the life of such a noble man could be so purposely deceptive.The actual letter was written by Washington in his later years, with his wife. He talked about how he was remembering the times of harmony and friendship that he and his wife spent with Sally and her husband at their home. He describes these times as some of the happiest of his life. At the end of his part of the letter he says ""Mrs. Washington is about to give you an account of the changes which have happened in the neighbourhood and in our own family.""Mr. Ellis said that in this letter he confessed that she had been the passion of his youth. That is simply a blatant falsehood.Ellis also states that there is no evidence to show whether the relationship between Washington and Fairfax ever crossed the sexual threshold or not. I ask, why even include such a ridiculous statement that makes people wonder? It is akin to saying that although someone spends some time at the local bank, we don't have evidence to show whether they were a bank robber or not.There is a popular trend in our country to try to insinuate that the framers of our Constitution such as Washington, Jefferson, and Franklin were immoral men.In an excellent book ""The Rewriting of America's History"", I found an example of how deceitful this influence can be. The book explained how in an earlier edition of a school history textbook it stated that George Washington had a hot temper that he kept masterfully controlled. In a later edition of the same textbook, it simply said: ""George Washington had a hot temper."" I think that is a powerful example of how a subtle adjustment can completely change our thinking of his character.I have found that this is happening more and more frequently in our world today as I have studied the founding father's lives including Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and others.I could continue on with how my research contradicts the opinions of Mr. Ellis, but I will simply recommend a much better book. ""The Real George Washington"", published by The National Center for Constitutional Studies.A favorite quote of mine, from LDS President Gordon B. Hinckley is: ""We recognize that our forefathers were human. They doubtless made mistakes. Some of them acknowledged making mistakes. But the mistakes were minor when compared with the marvelous work which they accomplished. To highlight mistakes and cover over the greater good is to draw a caricature. Caricatures are amusing, but they are often ugly and dishonest. A man may have a wart on his cheek and still have a face of beauty and strength, but if the wart is over emphasized in comparison to his other features, the portrait is lacking in integrity.""That sums up how I feel about this book. It attempts to cast a negative representation on the father of our country.You can look up the other ""one-star"" reviews of this book for more information.",0

This could just be the push that they need. The book helps you to let go and conquer your fear of a situation. We each have our own story and a detailed book cannot possibly give any more instructions for our own lives than this simple one does.,1
Searching for God Knows What,"In Searching for God Knows What, best-selling author Donald Miller invites you to reconnect with a faith worth believing. With humor, intelligence, and his trademark writing style, he shows that relationship is God’s way of leading us to redemption. And our need for redemption drives us to relationship with God. “Being a Christian,” Miller writes, “is more like falling in love than understanding a series of ideas.” Maybe you are a Christian wondering what faith you signed up for. Or maybe you don’t believe anything and are daring someone—anyone—to show you a genuine example of authentic faith. Somewhere beyond the self-help formulas, fancy marketing, and easy promises there is a life-changing experience with God waiting. Searching for God Knows What weaves together beautiful stories and fresh perspectives on the Bible to show one man’s journey to find it. “Like a shaken snow globe, Donald Miller’s newest collection of essays creates a swirl of ideas about the Christian life that eventually crystallize into a lovely landscape . . . [He] is one of the evangelical book market’s most creative writers.” —Christianity Today “If you have felt that Jesus is someone you respect and admire—but Christianity is something that repels you—Searching for God Knows What will give you hope that you still can follow Jesus and be part of a church without the trappings of organized religion.” —Dan Kimball Author of The Emerging Church and Pastor of Vintage Faith Church, Santa Cruz, CA “For fans of Blue Like Jazz, I doubt you will be disappointed. Donald Miller writes with the wit and vulnerability that you expect. He perfectly illustrates important themes in a genuine and humorous manner . . . For those who would be reading Miller for the first time, this would be a great start.” —Relevant",['Donald Miller'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YoYRhyRs-zsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=YoYRhyRs-zsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Searching+for+God+Knows+What&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Thomas Nelson,2010-05-24,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YoYRhyRs-zsC&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],25.0,0785263713,,AMWSZ61FILX2J,Michael Erisman,96/119,3.0,1118448000,"A meandering conversation, which is often profound","Donald Miller writes an appropriate follow up to his most recent book ""Blue Like Jazz"". Like ""jazz"" this book doesn't really seem to have a concise point or direction, but rather he writes as though he is engaged in a long conversation about life.After a rocky start (the first chapter ends with ""On to Chapter Two"" - indeed) Donald waxes poetically with deep prose about how we as humanity prioritize what's really valued. Using an analogy of a ""lifeboat"" he describes what it would be like to be not dependent on the absurdity of materialism, or ego, but rather on purpose, meaning and how we influence others.He then ventures into astute observations about how the bullet point, sound-bite means of communication reflects a whole new theology, as opposed to summarizing one. The truth is far more difficult to break down into simple easy bites, and must be gleaned from the whole he postulates. Throughout he relates deeply personal experiences, gives examples of emotional human interactions to illustrate his points, and is quite effective in doing so.At times I am left stunned by his observations, and how deeply profound they are. At other times he seems to ramble in generalities about life with all the depth of a new age incense shop. Yet, when all is said and done I still just don't quite know how to take him. Is he really onto something? Or is he on something?If you have an interest in spirituality, what Christianity is all about, or how to live your life to the fullest, should you read this book? You know, I just don't know. Suffice it to say that I was always engaged while reading, at times had a lump in my throat and at other times wanted to put the book down due to what I perceived as meaningless drivel. So, if you are an adventurous sort who likes to think, then give it a go. If you are looking for sound theology, or bullet points and short chapters along the likes of ""Christianity for Dummies"" then this is not what you want to read. Try the ""Purpose Driven Life"" for that.",1
"Slaves, Women & Homosexuals: Exploring the Hermeneutics of Cultural Analysis",This volume by William J.

He says the author departs from a grammatical-historical hermeneutic. That is an oxymoron... Grammatical and Historical are modes of exegesis, they give us some of the building blocks for understanding the text, but they are not a hermeneutic. The author provides a hermeneutic...which is a means of understanding and appropriating these texts. He argues, rightly I believe, that the New Testament leans in the way of renewal...this is its elan vital. Some of the material in the New Testament (and Old Testament)...is cultural. It won't do to say flippantly, if some is...what isn't cultural. In fact, the entire New Testament are cultural productions of their times...but some of the nitty gritty specifics cannot be read with a hermeneutic that remains static, as if we could transpose ourselves to the first century and live exactly as they did, because very quickly one is riddled with impossibilities and contradictions. In a flat reading, women are subjected, slavery is endorsed, and we get caught up in such questions as &quot;head-coverings&quot; and &quot;foot washing&quot; etc... With a reading that seeks to discern the direction, trajectory if you will, you can see why at times headcoverings were encouraged and women silenced and other times women encouraged to prophesy in the churches...by examining the overall direction of thought. Then, one uses a hermeneutic or mode of understanding, informed by this deeper level ... that allows us not to get caught up in the peripherals. Do we literally need to shake dust off our feet when someone rejects christian preaching? Do we literally need to great each other with a holy kiss? Do we literally castrate those who approach things legalistically (in Paul...read Galatians)...if so, the gentleman whose review appeared before mine is in big trouble.All in all, a good read!!!",1
The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference (Wheeler Compass),An introduction to the Tipping Point theory explains how minor changes in ideas and products can increase their popularity and how small adjustments in an individual's immediate environment can alter group behavior.,['Malcolm Gladwell'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=w6V_PwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=w6V_PwAACAAJ&dq=The+Tipping+Point:+How+Little+Things+Can+Make+a+Big+Difference+(Wheeler+Compass)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,"Wheeler Publishing, Incorporated",2003,http://books.google.com/books?id=w6V_PwAACAAJ&dq=The+Tipping+Point:+How+Little+Things+Can+Make+a+Big+Difference+(Wheeler+Compass)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Reference'],4218.0,1587243938,,A2RFA9KAIYGCHX,Sarah,96/118,1.0,1150761600,I've been duped!,"This book sucks. Don't waste your hard earned money on it. Let me save you a few bucks here: Malcolm Gladwell is either a very self-aggrandizing man who is too busy thinking he is the god of marketing to notice that a great majority of his arguments lack any kind of cohesion or credibility whatsoever, or he is just so excited about his self-proclaimed 'paradigmatic' keys to the essense of social epidemics that he conveniently forgets to include that much needed credible evidence to support his long-winded theories, resulting in a book fit to satiate the appetite of audiences hungry for pop pseudo-science BS that will make them feel smart for reading it. Basically all this book is is a compilation of antecdotal evidence that is supposed to prove the truth in his words. Gladwell's arguments clearly violate some very important rules guiding intelligent thought: correlation does not imply causation (and the fact that two events happened on one occasion at the same time does not necessarily imply correlation), and the idea that a theory is bankable because one instance of antecdotal evidence exists. Umm, okay, that's like saying that I know a guy who won the lottery (I don't, but humor me), so it must be a logically good place to invest my paychecks (I don't have paychecks, but, please, humor me). I mean, I'm a 21-year-old college student, and not even a GOOD college student at that, and I could easily point out the flaws in his arguments -not just a single argument, but ALL of his arguments -as soon as I read them. I didn't even have to put the book down to think for a few minutes before I realized how absolutely pointless and downright ludicrous his 'insights' were. All that aside, his writing style is so patronizing and self-congratulatory that I could hardly stand to read any more than five pages at a time before my face got all scrunched up and I started uncontrollably muttering curse words under my breath. It makes me sad that people read this book and consider it a revelation in modern psychological and scientific thinking, not seeing it for what it is: an apparently very successful (thanks, readers of America) profit-driven waste of time. Gladwell made a ton of money off what probably only took him, like, 15 minutes to write, and THAT is the only thing genius about this book.",0
Tour of the Calculus,"Were it not for the calculus, mathematicians would have no way to describe the acceleration of a motorcycle or the effect of gravity on thrown balls and distant planets, or to prove that a man could cross a room and eventually touch the opposite wall. Just how calculus makes these things possible and in doing so finds a correspondence between real numbers and the real world is the subject of this dazzling book by a writer of extraordinary clarity and stylistic brio. Even as he initiates us into the mysteries of real numbers, functions, and limits, Berlinski explores the furthest implications of his subject, revealing how the calculus reconciles the precision of numbers with the fluidity of the changing universe. ""An odd and tantalizing book by a writer who takes immense pleasure in this great mathematical tool, and tries to create it in others.""--New York Times Book Review",['David Berlinski'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Com9OzFJgRcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Com9OzFJgRcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Tour+of+the+Calculus&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Vintage,2011-04-27,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Com9OzFJgRcC&source=gbs_api,['Mathematics'],8.0,B000QBUJ90,,AROHO08SFR5Y,Michael Maltenfort (maltenfort@yahoo.com),96/116,1.0,936489600,Mathematically poor and stylistically overdone,"I hoped for an insightful view into calculus. Indeed, there are many deep and interesting aspects of calculus which are generally obscured in a typical calculus textbook (or in a calculus class). This is not such a book.Most disappointing was the constant distraction of mathematical errors, small and large, throughout the book. For example, there are typos, errors in notation, and misleading or confusing notation. For these problems, I understood the author's intention at these points (being a calculus teacher myself), but to a reader less familiar with calculus, these problems will hinder understanding. When a reader can't understand the mathematical details, much of the meaning is lost.A few errors were utterly irreparable, such as the proof of the Intermediate Value Theorem. In that case, a correct proof would diverge greatly from that of the author. This specific error is unfortunate because it is for this theorem that the author develops the real numbers (which takes chapters), and upon this theorem that all later theorems are based.Finally, I found the author's style annoying, especially the fictional accounts of specific actions taken by historical mathematicians (crossing a river, contemplating calculus while sitting in an overstuffed chair, etc.). The author must enjoy hearing himself wax poetic on any subject which enters his head, but I don't.The book's back cover likens this book to Douglas Hofstadter's classic _Godel, Escher, Bach_, but the comparison is laughable. Hofstadter's book has a direct and clear style of writing, whereas _A Tour of the Calculus_ is unfocused and its numerous errors makes it is mathematically a sham.",0
Blinded by the Right: The Conscience of an Ex-Conservative,"In a powerful and deeply personal memoir David Brock, the original right-wing scandal reporter, chronicles his rise to the pinnacle of the conservative movement and his painful break with it. David Brock pilloried Anita Hill in a bestseller. His reporting in The American Spectator as part of the infamous “Arkansas Project” triggered the course of events that led to the historic impeachment trial of President Clinton. Brock was at the center of the right-wing dirty tricks operation of the Gingrich era—and a true believer—until he could no longer deny that the political force he was advancing was built on little more than lies, hate, and hypocrisy. In Blinded By the Right, Brock, who came out of the closet at the height of his conservative renown, tells his riveting story from the beginning, giving us the first insider’s view of what Hillary Rodham Clinton called “the vast right-wing conspiracy.” Whether dealing with the right-wing press, the richly endowed think tanks, Republican political operatives, or the Paula Jones case, Brock names names from Clarence Thomas on down, uncovers hidden links, and demonstrates how the Republican Right’s zeal for power created the poisonous political climate that culminated in George W. Bush’s election. With a new afterword by the author, Blinded By the Right is a classic political memoir of our times.",['David Brock'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CZIzw4qk1x0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=CZIzw4qk1x0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Blinded+by+the+Right:+The+Conscience+of+an+Ex-Conservative&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Crown,2002-04-24,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CZIzw4qk1x0C&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],5.0,0812930991,,A3M6E9D30YEA5T,"Noam Deplame ""jamie@j51.com""",96/115,5.0,1015804800,The Civics Lesson of the New Century.,"Reading this book is liike flipping the record over and hearing, for the first time, the real hit. After 10 years of mysterious references to a vast Right-Wing Conspiracy we find that, although many of us scoffed at the notion, it actually existed. This book lays it all out, and will rearrange, permanantly, our foolish beliefs about the current state of representative Democracy. It is a precise and credible chronology of the hijacking of the American political system by a small but determined group of angry, irrational, and misguided individuals. Many of the players in this farrago are now the most powerful and influential figures in our governmemt, and utterly untouchable since 9/11. This confessional may turn out to be the most important historical and cultural document of the new century. It certainly casts light and heat on the past 10 years. I was tempted to disbelieve Brock, since I had been hearing serious criticism of his credibility long before the book was released, but it's become clear why he's been called into question, largely by the very same indiviuals he exposes here. He simply knows too much, and his account rings too true for their comfort. And it's long about time these folks suffered a little discomfort.Recommended to anyone who cares about this country, and believes in the ideals upon which it's based.

"The Scientist in the Crib: Minds, Brains, And How Children Learn","This exciting book by three pioneers in the new field of cognitive science discusses important discoveries about how much babies and young children know and learn, and how much parents naturally teach them.It argues that evolution designed us both to teach and learn, and that the drive to learn is our most important instinct. It also reveals as fascinating insights about our adult capacities and how even young children -- as well as adults -- use some of the same methods that allow scientists to learn so much about the world. Filled with surprise at every turn, this vivid, lucid, and often funny book gives us a new view of the inner life of children and the mysteries of the mind.","['Alison Gopnik', 'Andrew N.

I also wanted to know how scientists organize and practice the study of infant development; how do you observe an infant's actions and draw information about them based on what they do? (or don't do.) While The Scientist In The Crib is full of a lot of interesting anecdotes, and I certainly wouldn't question the authors' credibility, it is disappointingly organized around very general concepts as opposed to chronology, so that the thread of actual development is difficult to follow from one section to the next. This book really seems more like a series of articles, some more and some less interesting. The chapters examine what children learn about people [chapter 2], things [chapter 3], and then language [chapter 4], and then what scientists have learned about children's minds [chapter 5] and then what scientists have learned about children's brains [chapter 6](the distinction between minds and brains is probably much more meaningful if you're working in the field). There are two different sections entitled 'what newborns know.' I found myself skipping around looking for information relevant to my son and the age that he is now. I suppose if I was not so personally invested in these questions I could examine things in the lofty and generalized manner of this book, but, really, parenting is more a practical than a philosophical pursuit, and a chronological approach would have made the information (and there is a lot) much more accessible and interesting for parents.",0

Hard to avoid pedantry here, but the bread pretty obviously represents the Staff of Life, the values of the heartland and the pleasures of hearth and home, as well as a means of resurrection--in the most fundamental sense, he is taking communion. Coach's decision to abandon the bright lights (he won't need the sunglasses anymore) and turn back towards the basics is a triumphal moment in modern fiction.In an era when &quot;white bread&quot; has become pejorative, an author who has his hero saved by a bread roll is obviously trying to communicate something. It would be a shame if those same shallow folk whom the book is aimed at were to succeed in dismissing it as no more than a &quot;drug book&quot;. It is a really fine novel and one of the few significant social fictions, along with Bonfire of the Vanities and Love Always (Ann Beattie), to emerge from the 80's.GRADE: A",1
Lewis and Clark: Across the Divide,,['Gilman C'],,http://books.google.nl/books?id=eG4azQEACAAJ&dq=Lewis+and+Clark:+Across+the+Divide&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Smithsonian,2003-10-17,http://books.google.nl/books?id=eG4azQEACAAJ&dq=Lewis+and+Clark:+Across+the+Divide&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Indians of North America'],,1588340996,,,,96/112,4.0,1066521600,"Important book, marred by political correctness","This book is the catalogue to a Lewis &amp; Clark Exhibit being put together by the Smithsonian and Missouri Historical Society. First, the good news. The exhibit (and book) documents and presents over 400 objects and artifacts related to the L&amp;C expedition. These items have been gathered from institutions from all over the world (such as the American Philosophical Society, Smithsonian, Library of Congress, National Archives, etc.) The objects presented consists of maps, art work, journal excerpts, expedition artifacts, Indian artifacts. Some of the object are directly traced to the expedition; others (such as some of the Indian artifacts) are presented as examples of objects that Lewis &amp; Clark describe in their journals. Each object is described, photographed, and documented. One chapter of the book describes (with flow charts) how the expedition artifacts have traveled over the past 200 years and how the items reached various institutions. The photographs are beautiful, the book layout is stunning. The book is well-worth the money for this alone.Unfortunately, as with many Lewis and Clark books, the text (witten by Carolyn Gilman)is marred by political correctness.For example, one whole chapter is devoted to the role of women in the tribal society versus the roles of women in post-colonial society. Why this is relevant to the Lewis and Clark expedition escapes me. But then, I am a man, so I am likely too stupid to understand this. Ms. Gilman calls the biblical creation account in Genesis the &quot;Euro-American&quot; creation story. No Carolyn, the biblical creation story arose in Mesopotamia about 4000 years ago. The Corps of Discovery is basically presented as a bunch of stupid white men whose trip would have been so much easier if they had only listened to the Indians. Well, they did listen to the Indians, on many ocasions. At one point, she briefly mentions how the Corps hired an Indian (Old Toby) to guide the Corps through the Bitteroots. She fails to mention that Old Toby got them lost. However, this does not stop her from criticizing Clark for failing to listen to Sakajawea, who knew a shorter path. Apparently, in this case, Clark listened to the wrong Indian. She attributes the fact that the Corps was able to shoot the waterfalls on the Columbia River to &quot;luck,&quot; because the local Indian tribes were sure that the Corps would fail. Hey, why not praise the skill of the Corps? They had been paddling rivers for 1 1/2 years, maybe they learned something. Her most disgraceful writing is her all too brief description of William Clark's post expedition career, in which she accuses him of &quot;Ethnic Cleansing.&quot; Of course, she does not provide much detail to support this outrageous statement, which I consider to be gutless.These type of statements are most unfortunate because there is a lot of good information in the text. The descriptions of tribal society are excellent. The mapping section is, in general, very good, even though I don't accept some of the conclusions. For example, while the evidence certainly shows that the Corps was greatly surprised by some of this country's geographical surprises, the idea they couldn't accept them this is not supportable. Read their maps and journals. Lewis called his team &quot;The Corps of Discovery.&quot; He compared his expedition to Capt. Cook and Colombus. Why would he do that unless he expected to &quot;discover&quot; new things?To her credit, Ms. Gilman does discuss slavery as practiced by the Indians and even briefly mentions that some of the tribes did practice human sacrafice. That is almost never mentioned in most Lewis &amp; Clark books because, in my view, it would distract from politically correct view of the American Indians as the world's first hippies. However, like most Lewis &amp; Clark books, the author, in general, is &quot;value neutral&quot; when discussing Indian society, practices, and beliefs but highly judgemental when discussing Lewis and Clark. Why is it so hard to be value neutral in both cases and let the reader make the judgements?By the way, notice that I don't use the term &quot;Native American in my write-up. Why? Because most American Indians don't like it. You would have thought someone from the PC police would have asked American Indians what they thought of the term &quot;Native American&quot; before trying to force the rest of us to use it.",1

Sadly these are often not the case with this book.Rather, this book gives every sign of being essentially copied from bits of many dozens of other books. All the illustrations appear to be low-quality xerographic copies from other books (clearly used without any permissions).But worst of all, the book is chock full of misstatements, misconceptions, and sentences that don't convey any meaning.This book gives the non-expert reader the impression that he or she is learning something, but a great deal of the time this is just the illusion of learning.I will list a few of the errors and illusory learning that I can readily find:________p. 6: The illustration of the cycloid curve should show it to be in a vertical direction where one arch meets another; instead it is at 45 degrees to the vertical.________p. 7: It is stated that when marbles are released in a cycloid-shaped container, they will reach the bottom at the same time. This phenomenon occurs for a bowl whose cross-section is an *inverted* cycloid, but that is omitted.________p. 13: Both the ""impossible tribar"" and ""Hyzer's optical illusion"" are NOT mathematically impossible, contrary to what is written. (They can be constructed in 3 dimensions.) Twistors are mentioned but not defined, even in a rough, metaphoric way -- just not at all.________p. 18: It is mentioned that pi cannot be the solution of an algebraic equation with integral coefficients, but there is no discussion in the book of what such an equation is.__________p. 19: Also, it is stated that the probability of two randomly chosen integers' being relatively prime is 6/pi. Not only should the correct number be 6/(pi * pi), but the idea of randomly choosing an integer is left completely undiscussed, although there is no known way to do this.________p. 38: The Platonic solids (aka regular polyhedra) are discussed here, but although they are defined twice, neither definition is correct. (The author neglects to mention that the faces of such a solid must be *regular* polygons.)________p. 45: The Klein bottle is discussed and illustrated here, but there is no mention that a genuine Klein bottle cannot be constructed in ordinary 3-dimensional space. (The familiar model of a Klein bottle depicted here is a self-intersecting version of the real Klein bottle, which does not intersect itself. This is much like the fact that a picture of a knot drawn in the plane must appear as if the knot intersects itself, though it does not do so in space.)________p. 46: The illustration at bottom purports to show what the model of the Klein bottle would look like if it were sliced in half. The halves are erroneously shown as identical, but they should be mirror images of each other.________p. 78: The title of this page is ""Fractals -- real or imaginary?""This is an entirely misguided question that will only confuse the reader. All mathematical concepts are real within mathematics, and do not exist (except as approximations) in the real world.It's a worthwhile topic in the philosophy of mathematics, and could well have been introduced in this book, but it has nothing whatsoever to do with fractals per se.________p. 91: Here the author attempts to describe a model of hyperbolic geometry (in a circular disk) devised by Henri Poincar&eacute;. However, she gets it exactly backwards, saying that objects get smaller as they approach the boundary of the disk.(She may have been well-aware of how this model works, but her prose is at best completely ambiguous.)________p. 96: Here it is stated that it has been proved that knots cannot exist in more than 3 dimensions. Apparently the author is unfamiliar with an extensive and thriving field of higher-dimensional knots. (For example, a sphere can be knotted in 4-dimensional space.)________There are many, many more such gaffes, but I fear I have gone on too long. I just wanted to make it crystal-clear that this book is riddled with erroneous and vacuous statements.",0
Tales from the Left Coast: True Stories of Hollywood Stars and Their Outrageous Politics,"When Barbra Streisand sends Dick Gephardt a personal fax, it makes headline news. When international relations expert Sean Penn leads his own ""tour of peace"" in Baghdad, every news desk across the country reports it. It's no secret that Hollywood has a leftward tilt when it comes to politics. But what the celebrity-fawning media fail to show is how Hollywood's liberal bias affects actors, movies, and even public policy. In Tales from the Left Coast, author and political commentator James Hirsen digs deep into the liberal underbelly of Hollywood to reveal how biased politics have corrupted the entire entertainment industry. Through extensive research and scores of interviews, Hirsen uncovers some of the most ridiculous, infuriating, and damning political stunts pulled by celebrities of yesterday and today, and he traces the tangled web of influence the Hollywood elite have over politicians in Washington, D.C.","['James Hirsen', 'NewsMax']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7Q3QE-n8q4UC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=7Q3QE-n8q4UC&pg=PP2&dq=Tales+from+the+Left+Coast:+True+Stories+of+Hollywood+Stars+and+Their+Outrageous+Politics&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Crown Forum,2007-12-18,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7Q3QE-n8q4UC&source=gbs_api,['Political Science'],,0761517855,,,,96/112,5.0,1057363200,Jim Hirsen Exposes Hollywood Boobylon!,"James Hirsen, the ""Left Coast Report"" columnist for Newsmax.com, has parleyed his media contacts and research about the Hollywood Left into the most engaging account ever of Tinseltown's wacky ultra-liberal causes!

Tower of Babel: The Evidence against the New Creationism,"Creationists have acquired a more sophisticated intellectual arsenal. This book reveals the insubstantiality of their arguments. Creationism is no longer the simple notion it once was taken to be. Its new advocates have become more sophisticated in how they present their views, speaking of ""intelligent design"" rather than ""creation science"" and aiming their arguments against the naturalistic philosophical method that underlies science, proposing to replace it with a ""theistic science."" The creationism controversy is not just about the status of Darwinian evolution—it is a clash of religious and philosophical worldviews, for a common underlying fear among Creationists is that evolution undermines both the basis of morality as they understand it and the possibility of purpose in life. In Tower of Babel, philosopher Robert T. Pennock compares the views of the new creationists with those of the old and reveals the insubstantiality of their arguments. One of Pennock's major innovations is to turn from biological evolution to the less charged subject of linguistic evolution, which has strong theoretical parallels with biological evolution, both in content and in the sort of evidence scientists use to draw conclusions about origins. Of course, an evolutionary view of language does conflict with the Bible, which says that God created the variety of languages at one time as punishment for the Tower of Babel. Several chapters deal with the work of Phillip Johnson, a highly influential leader of the new Creationists. Against his and other views, Pennock explains how science uses naturalism and discusses the relationship between factual and moral issues in the creationism-evolution controversy. The book also includes a discussion of Darwin's own shift from creationist to evolutionist and an extended argument for keeping private religious beliefs separate from public scientific knowledge.",['Robert T.

Haines,96/112,5.0,1071964800,"Perceptive, penetrating and persuasive","Pennock's book denounces the attempts to incorporate religious dogma into public education. It is the finest of several analogous efforts published over two decades. With penetrating insight, he presents the full range of Christian creationist ideologies, many self contradictory. He examines how slandering Darwin's concept of natural selection [""evolution""] goes beyond biology. The real issue, he assures us, is the curtailing of the liberalisation of American society. In well-crafted prose, the author maintains your interest in a subject at once hilarious and terrifying. He declares that the issue is greater than religion versus science. It is one striking at the very root of American ideals.The book provides a general history of 20th Century ""creationism"", its programme and its proponents. The later ""Intelligent Design"" movement, which declares itself a ""science"" instead of a religious concept, Pennock declares a sham. Its influence is far too great, yet built from shoddy materials. Tracing the ideas and publications of such figures as Henry Morris and his followers, Pennock describes the propaganda techniques of the Institute for Creation Research and the recent wave material camouflaged under ""scientific"" or ""legal"" disguises. Pennock pores over their material, pinpointing their fallacies and exposing their tactics. He shows how evidence is ignored or twisted, explaining how ideology governs speeches, publications and strategy. Through it all, he shows how the Christians are as much at war with each other as they are with ""materialism"", the label they apply to Darwinian scholars.Pennock adopts the unique method of showing how the evolution of languages repeats the biological pattern. From an original, lost language, modern tongues evolved in different environments. It continues to evolve today. It's a fitting analogy, one which teachers should note and apply in the classroom. It's appropriate that a scholar of Pennock's stature should thus ally science with the humanities. As he points out, much of the assault on biological evolution could easily be applied to farming, home life and law.The author examines some of the renowned figures of the IDC cabal with a penetrating gaze. Pennock charitably skims over Michael Behe's ignorance of evolutionary process to focus on lawyer Phil Johnson. Johnson's legal training prompts him to address all questions in absolutes and to create straw men as easily demolished targets. Pennock simply dissects Johnson's writings to demonstrate not only false assumptions, but contradictions so severe as to inspire the reader to wonder how he maintains his academic position. According to Pennock, Johnson's works betray a messianic mentality from which he institutes a project to redeem American society. It's to Pennock's credit that the term ""demagogue"" doesn't appear in the text. One can only admire his forbearance.Pennock's patience must have been stretched in undertaking the research to produce this book. He has debated Darwin's defamers, suffered through the morass of creationist publications and endured the assault on evidence unashamedly displayed at the creationists' museum. It can hardly be beaten as an exercise in mental self-flagellation. Yet, this book results in a mine of information, reasoned analysis and fine exposition. Every science or humanities teacher in North America would do well to consider keeping a copy close at hand. It's an invaluable resource. [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]",1
Beautiful Lies: A Novel,"If Ridley Jones had slept ten minutes later or had taken the subway instead of waiting for a cab, she would still be living the beautiful lie she used to call her life. She would still be the privileged daughter of a doting father and a loving mother. Her life would still be perfect—with only the tiny cracks of an angry junkie for a brother and a charming drunk with shady underworld connections for an uncle to mar the otherwise flawless whole. But that’s not what happened. Instead, those inconsequential decisions lead her to perform a good deed that puts her in the right place at the right time to unleash a chain of events that brings a mysterious package to her door—a package which informs her that her entire world is a lie. Suddenly forced to question everything she knows about herself and her family, Ridley wanders into dark territory she never knew existed, where everyone in her life seems like a stranger. She has no idea who’s on her side and who has something to hide—even, and maybe especially, her new lover, Jake, who appears to have secrets of his own.

When everyone else is buying shares, these guys are advocating gold. When economic growth sits at a healthy 4.2% per annum - these guys preach gloom.The basis of their argument is the record US foreign debt, and they see this as the banana skin on which the USA will ultimately slip. The argument has some merits, but the outcome is not as inevitable as the authors argue.The irony of debt is that it can actually integrate an economy more closely with that of the rest of the world. Just as the old adage goes that if you have a million dollar overdraft at the bank, you get really great service, so too - if a nation has a high debt exposure, then the rest of the planet is more inclined to talk business. Who, after all, could afford to see America fail? Could China? Could Europe? I doubt it.So I'm not so sure that the gloom is warranted - and I find this tendency of today's political and economic commentators to choose one stance or another academically weak. The truth in economics is seldom anything but a series of ""but on the other hand..."" statements. Debt is bad...but on the other hand.Next question posed by the authors: Is America an Empire? Does it behave as an empire? These authors believe it does, but again I'm not so sure the truth is that simple. Sure, Iraq really does appear to be about oil hegemony at the highest politcal level - but on the other hand the American economy is made up of so many non-political commercial organisations that it is unrealistic to say that the USA behaves as a single minded Roman-styled empire. Microsoft, or Dell or Amazon will do their own thing with or without the politicians.So this alarmist book makes an interesting, entertaining quick read, but the thesis isn't deeply explored and the ideas are rather too glib. Your view of the book will depend upon your underlying political disposition, and that, ultimately is a failing of this text; it doesn't present any news that will either educate or even change our minds.",1

The subject is engrossing and important, but the book itself is not well-written. This accounts for the disparity in ratings that the book has received.It is fascinating to read about Malika'a unique and frequently heartbreaking life. The eldest daughter of a Morococcan general, she was taken from her family and adopted by the King. Western readers will find the tales of her life in the royal household surprising and enlightening. Not only was the lifestyle outrageously lavish, it was also consisted of customs and traditions that are completely different from our own. Malika was allowed to return to her own family as a young teenager. She only had a few years to get to know her father and enjoy life outside the confines of the palace. Her father before General Oufkir was implicated in a coup attempt against the King and was assassinated. The rest of the family - Malika, her mother, her oldest brother, three young sisters and three year old baby brother were summarily imprisoned. For twenty years they lived in increasingly brutal and inhumane conditions, persecuted by the King for their father's crimes and forgotten by the world. Thanks to their uncommon courage and ingenuity, the family was able to survive and eventually escape. It's not easy to read about many of the horrors and indignities that were heaped upon the Oufkirs, but it's important that the world know about their story.Unfortunately, the book is not worthy of this amazing story. It was written by Malika with the assistance of Michele Fitoussi. The first problem is that the book does not give sufficient background about either the history of Morrocco or General Oufkir's powerful role as one of the King's chief aides. Those unfamiliar with Moroccan history will frequently find themself at a loss for context. Second, given that this is Malika's first person account, it necessarily is a very one-sided version of history. Not that I doubt her version of events - I just would have preferred a more complete and well-researched book that included not only Malika's story but also those of her siblings. Malika frequently portrays herself as the backbone of the family, the strongest member who kept them all from succumbing to madness. This very likely is true, but it would have a much greater impact coming from someone else. Finally, the writing style is very repetitive and immature. While Michele Fitoussi is very sympathetic to Malika's story and deserves much credit for persuading her to tell her story, I have no doubt that a more objective and skilled writer would have improved the quality of the book immensely. Hopefully a serious scholar will undertake a complete telling of the Oufkir's story. I, for one, will be anxious to read it.",1

I found it one of the strongest and most powerful books I have read it a long time, with language that was exalted, and often hymn-like in its quality.Concerning the book, then, I would like to suggest a couple of things to readers and to those who suggest books for others to read:1)Don't read this book unless you know your Bible well, particularly the King James version. Without this as your base, I would guess that you'd find the language incredibly dense, and most of Baldwin's allusive power will blow past you.2)Don't read this book unless you have some experience in life. Again, I would think that the way Baldwin is able to put deep inner struggles and the feelings that rise from hard experience into words will remain lost to you unless you've had some hard experience of your own.3) If you're not African American, a little pre-reading into the Black experience in America might be helpful first, looking into particularly the Great Migration, the Azusa street revival, and the rise of the storefront church.4) Practice reading the book out loud!!

"Commies: A Journey Through the Old Left, the New Left and the Leftover Left",,,,,,,,,,189355452X,15.07,A37BASUCZG1WC9,Steven Fantina,96/108,5.0,1026172800,Set Free By the Truth,"Ronald Radosh was born to proud communist parents. He attended red elementary and high schools (whose curriculum could match any modern-day college campus) and even spent his childhood summers at socialist camp. His life story reads like the perfect description to yield a grown-up replication of Hillary Clinton or Bella Abzug. But something went right along the way.From a very young age, he embodied a devotion to the truth (or at least, like his parents, what he honestly believed was valid), and this veracity eventually lead him astray (or home depending upon one's point of view.) Ironically, the term ""fellow travelers"" has become cliche in communist circles, and Mr. Radosh uses it generously throughout this work, but he, the ex-communist, is the one who ""traveled"" away from a dead-end philosophy, while the so-called ""travelers"" continued to ram into brick walls, getting nowhere at all.The drive to satisfy his inquisitive nature lead to many disappointments with communist ideals, but three incidents seemed to cement his conversion from the failed mindset. Along with a select ruck of fellow travelers he was invited to spend a month in Cuba--an offer he joyously accepted. However, touring the island prison, he painfully learned that the Cuban reality was a far cry from communist lure. Despite communism's promise of complete equality, he encountered a nation where the ruling class lived like kings while the working class lived in hopeless squalor and dissenters and eccentrics were subject to arbitrary institutionalization, torture, and execution. Touring a mental hospital where innocent dissidents routinely underwent lobotomies tore Mr. Radosh's heart. However, his reaction was not shared by Castro's other American toadies; one of whom dismissed the author's concerns with the seriously spoken statement, ""We have to understand that there are differences between capitalist lobotomies and socialist lobotomies.""A second transmogrifying occurrence, that pays loud testimony to Mr. Radosh's integrity, was his undertaking the writing of what would become the definitive biography of the Rosenbergs. As a teenager, he had protested the spy couple's execution, fully convinced that they were innocent scapegoats murdered by a tyrannical government who had framed them for a false crime. He knew the Rosenberg sons, and in his circle Julius and Ethel were icons of unsurpassed stature. Upon the government's release of all documentation regarding the espionage case, Mr. Radosh determined to provide the martyred Rosenbergs posthumous exoneration. He was cataclysmically dismayed when the evidence conclusively proved that they were indeed guilty as charged. Many people with such strongly held convictions would have abandoned the project rather than publish a book that thoroughly refuted them. It speaks volumes about his character that he concluded his work despite having to change the thesis 180 degrees. Yet this inspiring honesty was not seen admirably by much of the left. ""The Rosenberg Files"" author earned widespread ostracization by his leftist peers, even many of those who agreed with its verisimilitude. Too many felt that the myth of the Rosenberg image should maintain its luster to sustain the cause--regardless of what the facts proved.The third and final disillusioning upheaval he experienced happened during Nicaragua's Civil War. Like all good leftists, he supported the Sandinista regime, and all like all good truth-seekers, he wanted to comprehensively investigate the issues involved. Embarking on a hegira to the Sandinista camps during the war, he was shocked by abundant human rights abuses in stark contrast to all the agitprop about the regime's liberation. Mingling with a veritable who's who of leftism, he humorously relates his meetings with Bianca Jagger. The internationally renowned airhead seemed especially defensive of one particularly brutal Sandinista general. The origin of her support soon became obvious, as he regularly arrived at the motel late at night and disappeared into her suite until the wee hours of the morning. Appalling many of his fellow traveling ideologues, by agreeing to venture someplace they would never go--The Contras' Camps, he was again rattled to see humanitarianism and a thrust for democracy and fairness. Publicly siding with the freedom-fighting contras once again earned him the wrath of his fellow travelers, but this time he moved on leaving them all behind.Ironically, it was the aimless fellow travelers who have repeatedly sacrificed their ideals to maintain allegiance to a cause whose bankruptcy constantly reveals itself. Ronald Radosh was the one who remained true to his principles--human rights, equality, fairness, and openness. He may have the liked platitudinous rhythms of socialism, but like anyone secure in his beliefs felt that further investigation is always beneficial. Although he bravely confesses that his misguided actions were extremely negative, he is correct in acknowledging that now ""the capacity for harm is diminished because so many stood solidly behind America while we tried to bring it down. The country is stronger for having encountered and withstood us."" Interestingly, while Mr. Radosh eventually found a rich sense of inner peace and self-respect, his adherence to ideals--rather than ideology--stands as a bold example that all of us, fellow travelers as well as those who never boarded, should emulate.",1

Also, there are recipes that call for &quot;brown rice&quot;, again for six-month-olds, with no explanation as to whether they mean cooked brown rice, like Uncle Ben's, or if there's an infant brown rice cereal (I've never seen it).

The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism Triumphs in the West and Fails Everywhere Else,"""The hour of capitalism's greatest triumph,"" writes Hernando de Soto, ""is, in the eyes of four-fifths of humanity, its hour of crisis."" In The Mystery of Capital, the world-famous Peruvian economist takes up the question that, more than any other, is central to one of the most crucial problems the world faces today: Why do some countries succeed at capitalism while others fail?In strong opposition to the popular view that success is determined by cultural differences, de Soto finds that it actually has everything to do with the legal structure of property and property rights. Every developed nation in the world at one time went through the transformation from predominantly informal, extralegal ownership to a formal, unified legal property system. In the West we've forgotten that creating this system is also what allowed people everywhere to leverage property into wealth. This persuasive book will revolutionize our understanding of capital and point the way to a major transformation of the world economy.",['Hernando De Soto'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZKOal2aylpgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=ZKOal2aylpgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Mystery+of+Capital:+Why+Capitalism+Triumphs+in+the+West+and+Fails+Everywhere+Else&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Basic Books,2007-03-20,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZKOal2aylpgC&source=gbs_api,['Business & Economics'],6.0,B0002X7VWU,,AAP7PPBU72QFM,"D.

"The Judgment of Paris: Manet, Meissonier and the Birth of Impressionism","The fascinating new book by the author of Brunelleschi’s Dome and Michelangelo and the Pope’s Ceiling: a saga of artistic rivalry and cultural upheaval in the decade leading to the birth of Impressionism. If there were two men who were absolutely central to artistic life in France in the second half of the nineteenth century, they were Edouard Manet and Ernest Meissonier. While the former has been labelled the “Father of Impressionism” and is today a household name, the latter has sunk into obscurity. It is difficult now to believe that in 1864, when this story begins, it was Meissonier who was considered the greatest French artist alive and who received astronomical sums for his work, while Manet was derided for his messy paintings of ordinary people and had great difficulty getting any of his work accepted at the all-important annual Paris Salon. Manet and Meissonier were the Mozart and Salieri of their day, one a dangerous challenge to the establishment, the other beloved by rulers and the public alike for his painstakingly meticulous oil paintings of historical subjects. Out of the fascinating story of their parallel careers, Ross King creates a lens through which to view the political tensions that dogged Louis-Napoleon during the Second Empire, his ignominious downfall, and the bloody Paris Commune of 1871. At the same time, King paints a wonderfully detailed and vivid portrait of life in an era of radical social change: on the streets of Paris, at the new seaside resorts of Boulogne and Trouville, and at the race courses and picnic spots where the new bourgeoisie relaxed. When Manet painted Dejeuner sur l’herbe or Olympia, he shocked not only with his casual brushstrokes (described by some as applied by a ‘floor mop’ ) but with his subject matter: top-hatted white-collar workers (and their mistresses) were not considered suitable subjects for ‘Art’. Ross King shows how, benign as they might seem today, these paintings changed the course of history. The struggle between Meissonier and Manet to see their paintings achieve pride of place at the Salon was not just about artistic competitiveness, it was about how to see the world. Full of fantastic tidbits of information (such as the use of carrier pigeons and hot-air balloons during the siege of Paris), and a colourful cast of characters that includes Baudelaire, Courbet, and Zola, with walk-on parts for Monet, Renoir, Degas, and Cezanne, The Judgment of Paris casts new light on the birth of Impressionism and takes us to the heart of a time in which the modern French identity was being forged.",['Ross King'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZKPCw8NWdg0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZKPCw8NWdg0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Judgment+of+Paris:+Manet,+Meissonier+and+the+Birth+of+Impressionism&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Anchor Canada,2012-01-11,"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZKPCw8NWdg0C&dq=The+Judgment+of+Paris:+Manet,+Meissonier+and+the+Birth+of+Impressionism&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Art'],13.0,1593978774,,A27P0LYW9VYF4F,Rico Lebrun,96/107,5.0,1138233600,Long Live the King!,"I dislike many history books.

He can take a time line filled with people, places and dates and keep me turning the page. He made me understand one of my favorite times in the history of art, the passing of the french academic tradition into more modern forms of art. King infuses the caracters with life and makes you care about them. We meet Manet and learn the hardships he endured trying to show his work under the Salon system. We are introduced to Meissonier, the reigning champion of art in the 1800's. Never heard of him? Same here. This book is the story of the ""greatest"" artist, who we have completly forgotten and an artist who never was accepted in his life time, whom we all know.THAT is the suff of great literature and life lessons.

It certainly appears that the global elite and those who control the monetary standard of life leave no stone unturned in their wicked pursuits and show no remorse from its adverse effects on the common populace.Early on in the book, the presidential election of 2000 (focusing on Florida) is put under the microscope with some dramatic revelations. Thousands of registered U.S. voters were denied their right to vote, many of them African-Americans. A thorough explanation is well detailed to show the reader how this occurred. Obstruction of civil rights and bias immediately come to mind coupled with the fact that statistically, African-Americans in Florida predominantly vote democratic. Coincidence? Not likely.Farther along, the book describes how the Bush family has indeed been linked with the Bin-Laden family (not Osama himself) in Saudi Arabia regarding business ventures. Not for public knowledge of course, the presidential administration ordered the Department of Justice (FBI) to steer clear of any revealing investigations concerning this match not made in heaven. The sum total, to a point, is that the United States may have missed out on critically valuable information regarding terrorism.Rounding out this review, chapter 4 of the book gives you a taste of the heinous activities of the IMF (International Monetary Fund). Here's a group that likes to throw third world and even developed countries into chaos with outrageous financial policies and procedures. One example is privatizing water and power structures and then financially bleeding consumers to death with exaggerated fees. Another that I found most distasteful was in Tanzania. A relatively poor African country with a rampant AIDS epidemic now charges fees for hospital appointments and charges fees for school attendance, all courtesy of the IMF.These above summations are just the tip of the iceberg. The book has many more disturbing and revealing chapters that readers will find very interesting. Finishing off, Greg Palast sends a clear message that the mainstream media is not your friend and they love to expose critical news stories long after public sentiment has elapsed and damage control has been completed. As a former governor of Minnesota once said, the media is no longer in the business of reporting the news, they are in the business of creating the news.Greg Palast has written an outstanding, although disturbing book of who actually controls power and money and their machinations to sweep aside the little people regardless of consequences. This is a highly recommended read for those that are fed up and those looking for answers.",1

When Genius Failed: The Rise and Fall of Long-Term Capital Management,"“A riveting account that reaches beyond the market landscape to say something universal about risk and triumph, about hubris and failure.”—The New York Times NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY BUSINESSWEEK In this business classic—now with a new Afterword in which the author draws parallels to the recent financial crisis—Roger Lowenstein captures the gripping roller-coaster ride of Long-Term Capital Management. Drawing on confidential internal memos and interviews with dozens of key players, Lowenstein explains not just how the fund made and lost its money but also how the personalities of Long-Term’s partners, the arrogance of their mathematical certainties, and the culture of Wall Street itself contributed to both their rise and their fall. When it was founded in 1993, Long-Term was hailed as the most impressive hedge fund in history. But after four years in which the firm dazzled Wall Street as a $100 billion moneymaking juggernaut, it suddenly suffered catastrophic losses that jeopardized not only the biggest banks on Wall Street but the stability of the financial system itself. The dramatic story of Long-Term’s fall is now a chilling harbinger of the crisis that would strike all of Wall Street, from Lehman Brothers to AIG, a decade later. In his new Afterword, Lowenstein shows that LTCM’s implosion should be seen not as a one-off drama but as a template for market meltdowns in an age of instability—and as a wake-up call that Wall Street and government alike tragically ignored. Praise for When Genius Failed “[Roger] Lowenstein has written a squalid and fascinating tale of world-class greed and, above all, hubris.”—BusinessWeek “Compelling . . . The fund was long cloaked in secrecy, making the story of its rise . . . and its ultimate destruction that much more fascinating.”—The Washington Post “Story-telling journalism at its best.”—The Economist",['Roger Lowenstein'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-xgOQ6jnQooC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=-xgOQ6jnQooC&printsec=frontcover&dq=When+Genius+Failed:+The+Rise+and+Fall+of+Long-Term+Capital+Management&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Random House Trade Paperbacks,2001-10-09,http://books.google.com/books?id=-xgOQ6jnQooC&dq=When+Genius+Failed:+The+Rise+and+Fall+of+Long-Term+Capital+Management&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Business & Economics'],27.0,B00005QTH9,,A2WZ1B92F81LJJ,"O. Buxton ""Olly Buxton""",96/107,3.0,1054252800,Entertaining dose of schadenfreude - but inferior product,"A couple of years ago I read Nick Dunbar's account of the LTCM collapse &quot;Inventing Money&quot;, and a friend recently lent me this book. They make an interesting comparison.Dunbar - a physicist by trade - is more interested in the theoretical economics that went into the risk arbitrage fund in the first place and how this came unstuck. He gives a long description of the Black-Scholes model, what it says, and how it was used to pull off the risk &quot;free&quot; trades which made Long Term so much money for three or four years.Lowenstein, by contrast, barely mentions either the Black-Scholes model (he barely touches on option pricing at all, as a matter of fact) or the Italian convergence trades which eventually blew the gaffe on the fund, but instead tells the human story, exposes the inevitable egos, and indulges in more than a little smuggery (this book is long on wisdom after the fact) in dissecting the naivety of the LTCM hedging and trading strategy and the people who ran it.As long as he sticks to the egos and the posturing, When Genius Failed is a dandy read: the negotiations amongst the Wall Street top brass as the fund is going under rate with anything served up in Barbarians at the Gate, and as this is a large part of the book, it rips along quite nicely.But the schadenfreude grates: One of the lessons of the whole fiasco was that the smart money is with the guy who can predict the future: any old mug can be a genius with hindsight. Lowenstein spends a lot of his time wisely pointing out what the traders should have done.Additionally, Lowenstein employs some metaphors which indicate he might not have much of a grip on his subject: for one, he states &quot;a bit of liquidity greases the wheels of markets; what Greenspan overlooked is that with too much liquidity, the market is apt to skid off the tracks.&quot; It's a poor metaphor, because it isn't excess liquidity which causes markets to skid, rather, it's the sudden disappearance of it. As this is the fundamental lesson of the Long Term story, it's a bad mistake to make for the sake of a smart-alec aphorism.Similarly, in the epilogue states, with regard to the putative diversification in the fund &quot;the Long-Term episode proved that eggs in separate baskets *can* break simultaneously&quot;. Again, this conclusion is not supported by the text, which observes several times that in a market crash, liquidity drains and the correlation risk of instruments in the market goes to one: that is to say, it turns out all your eggs are in the same basket after all. Diversity wasn't the problem; the problem was you wrongly thought you had it.For these reasons I prefer Dunbar's more academic work: it may not be such a sizzling read, but nor does it misguidedly kick a fund when it's down.",0
Was Karl Marx a satanist?,"Karl Marx (1818-1883) became the most famous author and progenitor of early Socialist and Communist movements. Adam Weishaupt of the Illuminati in 1776 believed enlightenment could only be achieved through Lucifer. Marx continued his work. The theories of early Communism apply today to our Democratic Party and organizations like Black Lives Matter and Antifa which have succumbed to Marxist infection and brainwashing. Marx's penchant for destruction and Satanism, his racism, and his employment by rich capitalists, are just some of his characteristics that today's Marxists don't want you to know about. The identity and callous nature of the ""Satanists"" behind the Radical Socialist and Communist movements will shock you. We can define ""Satan"" as the symbol of ""the destructive forces forming the antithesis to the Christian God."" Communism uses a form of Satanism to take not only souls but also wealth and the control of the labor force and government. With this definition, all Communists, relative to Christian nations, can be labeled ""Satanists."" One doesn't have to be sacrificing animals, babies, or virgins in Demonic rituals chanting ""Hail Satan"" and participating in orgies afterward to be a ""Satanist."" However, ""High Priest"" Karl Marx demonstrated considerable knowledge about Satanic rituals in his poetry and dramas and rejected ""the one who ruled from above"" as he was admittedly destined for hell.SUMMARY OF EVIDENCE THAT KARL MARX WAS A SATANIST001 Marx's Communist Manifesto specifically attacked Christianity to establish a Communist State.002 Marx received letters from his son with the salutation ""Dear Devil."" Marx's wife referred to him as ""Bishop"" and ""High Priest""--which is specific to Satanic cults. A letter from his father showed concern that Marx had been possessed by a demon. These letters suggest Marx was a Satanic cult member which was popular at that time.003 Although writing about Satanism doesn't make one a Satanist, Marx demonstrated his extensive knowledge of Satanic rites and wrote a drama about making a pact with the Devil.004 Marx was hired to update Adam Weishaupt's work who was a prominent Illuminati, who were, in turn, occultists.005 Marx wrote extensively that he sided with Satan over God, and had a personal vendetta against God.006 Illuminism dominated Weishaupt's work, which Mark partially plagiarized for his Communist Manifesto. Illuminism states that enlightenment must come through Lucifer.007 Marx's economic theories were proven by history to be patently wrong, but his argument for violent terrorism and revolution resulted in up to 150 million deaths and untold suffering as part of regime change.008 Marx had a motive to detest Christianity, it had forced his family, with a long history of rabbi members, to convert from Judaism to have a chance to succeed in society.009 Marx was an expert in the ""Heart and Soul"" of Communism, the art of Dialectical Materialism, that also underlies Satanism as the antithesis of God.010 Marx had close friends who were admittedly Satanists, such as Proudhon and Bakunin, who were in frequent correspondence with him.This book also includes a Communist and sympathizer Blacklist of modern adversaries of the free world and why they made the list. The Blacklist includes lengthy sections on people like Nancy Pelosi, Joe Biden, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC), John Kerry, Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, David Axelrod, Rahm Emanuel, Jesse Jackson, Bobby Rush, Opal Tometi, Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, Amy Klobuchar, and Ilhan Omar.",['Scott CAMPBELL'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WJ2-zQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=WJ2-zQEACAAJ&dq=Was+Karl+Marx+a+satanist%3F&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,2020-07-27,http://books.google.com/books?id=WJ2-zQEACAAJ&dq=Was+Karl+Marx+a+satanist%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api,,,B000HLS4SW,,A1ISYXKJ7IQR8B,David Marshall,96/106,3.0,1085184000,Deserves serious consideration.,"As a grad student in China studies, I once made the mistake of referring to Marx and Satan in the footnote of a paper for a very by-the-book scholar. He circled the title in heavy red ink and wrote in the margin with even heavier sarcasm: ""Might the book have a bias?""Richard Wurmbrand certainly did have a bias, though not the one the ""one star"" reviewers below accuse him of. No, this is not ""anti-Semitic drivel;"" Wurmbrand was himself a Jew, persecuted by the fascists for his race, who loved his people. No, he is not a ""reactionary fanatic,"" nor does this book represent ""the scarier mindscapes of the Bible Belt."" Wurmbrand is actually from Romania, which is I believe some distance from Texas, and you read his many fascinating books, you will find he was actually quite thoughtful. But yes, he was biased against communism. He spent many years in slave labor camps, was tortured, and saw friends die. (A slave labor camp, I might point out, is rather a scarier place than a Southern Baptist church; tens of millions of people died in such places in the last century.)Despite the provocative title of this book, such experiences did not render Wurmbrand bitter or unhinged. His argument here is not a vitriolic piece of ad hominem; rather it is a serious suggestion, backed up, it seems, by a fair amount of circumstantial evidence.It is commonly argued that Marx had nothing to do with the crimes of communism. Even if Wurmbrand's central thesis does not convince you, the evidence he offers does at least show the spiritual or psychological continuity between Marx and the crimes committed in his name.The book has its flaws, true. The evidence Wurmbrand offers is not overpowering. Wurmbrand sometimes takes phrases like ""demonic fury"" a little too seriously; I suspect it was often mere hyperboli. Also, he is not critical enough with his sources. Although he does not base anything on it, in one place he seems to accept the ""Ritual Satanic Abuse"" scam, for example. Finally, the book is a bit gossipy.Still, Wurmbrand knows a great deal about communism. He seems to have read very widely in primary sources, and provides strongly suggestive quotes to back up his thesis. He shows caution at times, and is knowledgeable and thoughtful.A few months ago I came across a dissertation in my university library entitled ""The Role of Atheism in the Marxist Tradition."" The author of the dissertation, a journalist named David Aikman, wrote it under the guidance of Donald Treadgold, editor of the Slavic Review and a leading historian of the Soviet Union. It was interesting to me to find that Aikman took Wurmbrand's thesis very seriously, and in his own study of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, had found additional evidence that seemed to point in the same general direction.What did Marx and his chief disciples really believe? As Wurmbrand admits, Marx and Satan is not the final word on that question. But I think this little book does point out a set of facts that more conventional history largely ignores, and that ought to be considered; and not only as an intellectual curiosity. Wurmbrand was not an arm-chair critic, but a witness, survivor, philosopher, and passionate lover of God and man. The facts he points out, and his observations on this subject, are worth considering, if not just for their own sake, for the sake of those who died.author, Jesus and the Religions of Man",0

Mr. Ferry has a business process in mind that allows you to be more effective with your time and money, and to reinvest some of that time and money to create even greater results. Mr. Ferry has been a successful broker, and has been a top trainer in the field (based on those experiences) for many years.Only the top 3-4 percent or so of brokers made six figure incomes when this book was written, and this book is squarely focused on how to get you into that narrow area. I think this book will be of most value to those who want to make a high income, and are excited about trying new techniques to make themselves more effective.Although I do not practice as a real estate broker (although I am licensed), this book fits my understanding of how that business works. The most productive parts are when you get a listing or make a sale. Mr. Ferry shows you how to get more listings in time and cost efficient ways, and to have the way you get those listings help you make sales more easily.Here's what he has to say about this process: &quot;It's not uncommon to see a salesperson's production double within months after starting to use the tools given here.&quot; &quot; . . . [T]reat your real estate career as a busines. You can then use proven techniques for increasing your productivity.&quot;The introduction gets the book off to a fast start with excellent ideas for setting goals for your psychological, spiritual, family, physical, and financial success. He then encourages you to create action plans for each goal area, and to start taking action in the first five minutes after writing the plans. People with written goals and plans like these outperform the rest of the world routinely. He also encourages you to break your old habits, to ask for help where it is needed, to be sure you understand what you should be doing, and to keep going whenever you get something to work. In this way, he wants you to create excitement that will overcome whatever procrastination you may have.Willie Sutton said that he robbed banks because that was where the money was. Real estate brokers have to ask real estate owners about their plans to sell and buy all of the time -- that's where the real estate transactions are. He describes how to do this if you have a natural community to draw on (like your church or club). He also encourages you to try cold-call door knocking, and compare the results. For many new brokers, the cold-call door knocking will work faster and be less expensive. After you are more successful, you can hire someone to help you with this through mailings and telemarketing. He encourages you to do this prospecting all of the time. A recommended target is For Sale By Owner properties (most will eventually hire a broker). Expired listings are also a good source of new listings. You will find many scripts to help you with these contacts.Once you have a lot of listings, you will make a lot of sales. Good processes for working with buyers are described here as well.Once you have a lot of sales, it's easier to get listings because you can promote how many sales you make. Sellers are looking for top sellers!Many brokers will be uncomfortable with his advice. But you can probably rewrite the scripts so that they feel authentic coming from you. That will also help you with procrastination, if you are like me.He offers several plans for getting started. I suggest that you try one that is for an activity level you can stick with.Chapter 12 has a number of examples of people who are getting great results. I found those examples particularly helpful, because it made it clear to me that you don't have to be a Mike Ferry clone to have more time for yourself, more self-esteem, more control in your life, and more income.Good luck with improving your real estate business!After you have been using his process for 90 days, I suggest that you take a look at where you have been most successful in getting listings and do more of that. Also, analyze the places where you have been less successful by asking those who turned you down how you could have improved in approaching them. If you do this every 90 days, you should get even better results!",1

The Collected Works of St. John of the Cross,"THE Carmelite Order was originally devoted to a purely contemplative life. Its members lived as hermits on Mount Carmel, striving to imitate the holy prophets Elias and Eliseus. According to their Rule—which, given about A.D. 1210, records the customs observed by these hermits since they became a body corporate—they spent their time in or near their cells, meditating on the law of the Lord day and night, repairing only once a day to the oratory to hear mass. They said their office or their Paters privately, and took their more than frugal meals in solitude. James de Vitry thus speaks of these hermits: ‘Others, following the example of Elias, that holy anchorite and great prophet, embraced the eremitical life on Mount Carmel, chiefly on the part overlooking the town of Porphyry, now called Caiffa, near the fountain of Elias, not far from the monastery of S.

Carmel, The Dark Night, the Spiritual Canticle and The Living Flame of Love.My complaint has to do with the very prosaic nature of the translations. The abovementioned major works in this edition are written in academic American English. Even the layout screams &quot;textbook.&quot; I first came upon John's major works online, on a site called &quot;Ethereal Library.&quot; I read The Dark Night and Ascent .. in translations that captured a much greater sense of John's poetry and mysticism, as well as a sense of his own time and place in slightly (but not overwhelmingly) archaic language, where even the layout suggested more a long prose-poem than academic text. That other version was flavorful, glowing and delicious and, after reading it, I fell in love with St. John of the Cross.Had I read this rather dry, textbook-style version first, I probably would have dismissed St. John as boring and difficult.

I was not disappointed. The book contains a wealth of information for increasing your intellect and gaining access to the subconscious mind. I was hopeful, but at the same time somewhat cynical about techniques such as Freenoting, Photoreading and Socratic Learning, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt. I have put all three into effect, among others, and have learnt to trust my unconscious insights and to control my 'Editor'. I am a university student studying macroeconomics, and I was cramming for my exams weeks before. Usually I would have been anxious, but since I had become familiar with some of the methods in the book I felt confident in my ability to learn before the exam and to perform on the day. I felt relaxed (the book teaches you about that as well). My enthusiasm for study has increased greatly. It's wonderful to know that after a short period spent Photoreading you can go to bed, because the brain absorbs what you have learnt during sleep! And instead of tedious notetaking I make amusing comments and witty remarks about what I am reading, often scribbling on the text itself (in pencil). When reviewing, I made fun.Photoreading is based on relaxed unconscious learning. It is so powerful that when reading through copious amounts of academic texts I merely flick through the pages, without focusing on the words on the page. eye with no conscious effort on my part. I kid you not. It took me a bit of time to realise this and I'm still learning to confine myself to reading only the bits that this intuition leads me to, but I'm getting there. subtle in their effects. If you consciously look out for your 'inner voice' or for subtle insights, the chances are that you won't find them. You've got to be relaxed and you've got to be patient and learn to not put your mind under pressure to perform. You will not be disappointed.I wasn't Factor's instructions, I proceeded to Photoread my entire macroeconomics textbook several times over a number of weeks. The book is hundreds of pages long, yet each Photoreading session only took about 15 minutes. Soon, I found myself focusing on certain chapters, which I 'sensed' were the areas I needed to read. When I eventually sat down to learn macroeconomics the conventional way, I was getting insights before the author had confirmed them in the text, and new information felt familiar and comfortable. I was 'drawing it out' of my unconscious and creating something new. I was reaching fresh insights. I couldn't believe it. Needless to say, I now find macroeconomics rather enjoyable!The Einstein Factor has become a part of my life. Not only do the techniques accelerate your mind, but the book's a good read as well. It's written in a clear manner with informative diagrams, is well paced in its progression and has snippets of intriguing information on topics ranging from quantum physics and the 'ideal realm' to Mozart and the evolution of man's intelligence through the ages (memetic evolution). It's a quality product; a pleasure to spend time with. I'm getting it for my sister as a birthday present. Trust me, you want to get it too. And y'know what? I haven't even been concentrating on Wenger's main technique, Image Streaming. I've only tried it a handful of times. And yet during this time I have started to dream (or rather, started to recall my dreams) during REM sleep. I have had brainwaves coming out of the blue, and I mean 'Eureka!' I have begun creative writing and consciously use all my senses in my day to day life. The potentials for further development with time and persistence are mind-boggling.I didn't even realise how much this one book had impacted on my life until I sat down to write this review. That's how subtle the the event, because you'll be in flow and totally focused. You'll be in that state that's referred to as 'being in the zone', when anything is possible. Win Wenger has dubbed it 'creative fire'. And anyone can get there. It's certainly my goal.Win Wenger and Richard Poe have put together a masterpiece.

The Way the World Works,,,,,,,,,,B00005X502,,A2XVQ4MRD9RZ79,Todd Winer,96/105,5.0,967334400,"Twenty Years Later, Wanniski Has Been Justified","&quot;The Way The World Works&quot; is a brilliant andprovocative book that illuminates the reader on a full range of political, economic, and social issues. Mr. Wanniski alerts us to what he describes as &quot;the global electorate.&quot; The author sees human civilization as an unfolding story where societies find the best political and economic systems through a trial and error process. This process, which continues through the present, is largely progressive. &quot;The global electorate&quot; has rewarded systems that work, like American democracy, and dissolved systems that don't work like Soviet communism. History moves forward to suit the needs of its people. When Mr. Wanniski wrote this book in the late 1970s, such ideas as &quot;historical progress&quot; seemed out-of-date. Assertions of Western superiority over other political systems seemed naive. After all, the Communist empire was expanding into remote corners of the globe like Afghanistan and Nicaragua while the United States and Europe sputtered economically and splintered socially. But from his home in New Jersey, Mr. Wanniski anticipated the revival of the West. Led by Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, the capitalist democracies rediscovered the secrets of their success - classical &quot;supply-side&quot; economics. Much of the book articulates current economic issues through the prism of supply-side economics. Mr. Wanniski offers keen insight into the origins of the Great Depression and the causes behind the oil price surge of the 1970s. You may be surprised. He is especially persuasive in articulating the need for tax cuts. Mr. Wanniski argues that tax cuts pay for themselves by encouraging more entrepreneurship, unleashing more economic growth, and thus funneling more tax revenue into the Treasury. For example, after World War I, the U.S. and Britain took different approaches in shifting from a wartime to a peacetime economy. The U.S. slashed its tax rates and prospered during the 1920s while Britain kept its rate high and remained stuck in Depression. Britain never really corrected its mistake and spent most of the century in retreat as a world power. Mr. Wanniski sees tax policy as the key intangible in explaining why some Third World nations have prospered since decolonization whereas others have regressed. The U.S., in particular, was ahead of the curve until the late 1960s when Washington abandoned classical economics for Keynesianism. &quot;Tax-and-spend&quot; policies, designed to spark consumer-driven demand, only undercut the private economy. When taxes were raised, counter- intuitively, tax revenues fell. By painfully experiencing the shortcomings of Keynesianism during the 1970s, the U.S. stumbled into the success of the 1980s. Federal revenues doubled in the 1980s even as tax rates held constant. The new Western dynamism could not be ignored by citizens in socialist countries. By decade's end, communist dictatorships in Europe and Asia were throwing in the towel. A new chapter in the story of &quot;the global electorate&quot; is just beginning. One of the most intriguing points in Mr. Wanniski's book is that politics has been absolutely crucial to economic development. A nation's prosperity rests in large part, he contends, on the wisdom on its political leaders. This may be a lot for some conservatives to swallow but the author documents his points thoroughly and convincingly. If Mr. Wanniski is correct, then the next presidential election becomes even more significant. Is the current prosperity the handiwork of a) President Clinton, b) the Republican Congress, c) both, or d) none of the above. The answer, even now, isn't clear. But if the next president ignores &quot;the global electorate&quot; and strays from the supply-side course, the citizens will eventually correct their error in time - just like they did by dissolving Keynesianism in the 1980s. According to this book, we will collectively get where we need to go. Whether we reach our ultimate destination peacefully and rapidly, or on the other hand - painfully and slowly, is the question before us.",1

Professor Walter Kaufmann does an admirable job describing the evolution of Nietzsche's philosophy, his anti-system yet systematic approach, the will to power, eternal recurrence and much more. I recommend reading at least Beyond Good and Evil before taking this on in order to get a feel for Nietzsche and his ideas.Walter Kaufmann was arguably the best translator of Friedrich Nietzsche into any language and is responsible to a large extent for his rehabilitation after World War II. In contrast to those who attempt to trash Kaufmann (see especially the reviews to Will To Power) he was better equipped to interpret Nietzsche than the vast majority of amateur Nietzscheans today. First Kaufmann was German-born, meaning that he had a native ability with that language. Normally when choosing a translator it is the normal requirement that the target language - in the case of Nietzsche's German, English is the target language - is handled by a native speaker. Kaufmann was an exception to this rule in that his English was exceptional; his writing is better than most native English speakers. In addition to that he had the intuitive feel for Nietzsche's German that only a native speaker of that language could have. Consider too the cultural context. His generation was closer to Nietzsche's than ours, he grew up in and knew intimately the culture that had produced Nietzsche. With all this in mind, for someone to then come along, say a 30ish American with perhaps a smattering of High School German, and attempt to trash Kaufmann (all the while using his translations which one would expect were tainted) shows a distinct lack of intellectual consistency. In other words if Kaufmann is wrong, don't rely on his translation, go back to the original German yourself to make your argument, or give up the effort.However I expect that the main reason to attack Kaufmann is political. Today there are those who wish to reclaim Nietzsche for the Nazis even after Kaufmann decisively demolished the arguments for that connection. Those who wish to portray Nietzsche as a racist who focused on breeding and bloodlines ignore what the man actually wrote and betray more about their own opinions than Friedrich Nietzsche's. Far from being a proto-Nazi, Nietzsche in his own words comes across more as the Anti-Hitler or rather more to the point Hitler was the Anti-Nietzsche. Is it so surprizing that German culture was capable of producing both? Although in Hitler's case, I find him more a product of the times, than of any particular culture.Much has been made of the fact of Hitler's fascination with Nietzsche. As a young soldier he most likely read Zarathustra, which was issued in mass to German troops in World War I along with the Bible. Like most readers who start with that book and read nothing else of Nietzsche, he understood little of the man's ideas. As Kaufmann mentions on page 292, the Nazis got their racial theories not from Nietzsche, but from Hans F.K. G&uuml;nther who in turn was greatly influenced by the American racists Madison Grant and Lothrop Stoddard among others. Stoddard, a Harvard professor in the 1920's, is an interesting figure, in a certain perverse way, almost forgotten today except among white supremacists. His views (along with Grant's) on the Germans classified them as racially mixed with only a small quantity of superior ""Nordic"" blood. One wonders the influence this view had on Nazi policies and their fanatic and murderous efforts to ""cleanse"" foreign elements from their bloodlines. In fact Stoddard's influence on the Nazis clearly outweighs anything they got from Nietzsche, but while Stoddard is unacceptable today for mass consumption, Nietzsche's appeal goes on. Any attempt to link Nietzsche to the Nazis must be seen as the cheap political fascist trick it is.",1
The Outsiders,"Celebrate the 50th anniversary (April, 2017) of a landmark coming-of-age American novel with a Penguin Classics edition featuring an introduction by Jodi Picoult, author of My Sister's Keeper. Nominated as one of America’s best-loved novels by PBS’s The Great American Read First published in 1967, S. E. Hinton's novel was an immediate phenomenon. Today, with more than eight million copies sold, The Outsiders continues to resonate with its powerful portrait of the bonds and boundaries of friendship. In Ponyboy's world there are two types of people. There are the Socs, the rich society kids who get away with anything. Then there are the greasers, like Ponyboy, who aren't so lucky. Ponyboy has a few things he can count on: his older brothers, his friends, and trouble with the Socs, whose idea of a good time is beating up greasers. At least he knows what to expect-until the night things go too far. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.",['S.

We follow the tragic downfall of Milton, the drunken patriarch, Ellen, the frigid mother, and the two Loftis daughters, one born perfect, one born crippled. It is a novel of abundant ontological truth, which will reach in and strangle the unconscious sensibilities of almost any reader, regardless of background or predispotition.

As I read other books about ancient Egypt, I realized I had already learned and retained quite a bit about it already just by reading this children's book! I think the author really researched her subject well.I would highly recommend this book as an educational book, or just for fun. After the first few chapters, the story does become pretty exciting, and at the end I was left wanting more.",1
Lie Down in Darkness,"As Milton Loftis follows the hearse in which his beautiful daughter, Peyton, is being carried to the grave, a story unfolds about the degeneration of a tormented Southern family submerged in infidelity and vengeful love",['William Styron'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kBZiHVmIf2kC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=kBZiHVmIf2kC&q=Lie+Down+in+Darkness&dq=Lie+Down+in+Darkness&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Vintage,1992,http://books.google.com/books?id=kBZiHVmIf2kC&dq=Lie+Down+in+Darkness&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],12.0,B000J67YLS,,A2QZ0UPXBFK9SP,Glenn W. Wall,96/104,5.0,958521600,Lie Down In Darkness perfects Southern Gothic,"Lie Down In Darkness, Styron's first novel, published when he was just 22, is a masterpiece of psychological realism and storytelling in the Southern Gothic tradition of Faulkner, Eudora Welty, and Flannery O'Conner. That it was created by such a young mind is testament to the author's genius; that it has yet to be rivaled as a stirring, oftentimes painful and disturbing portrait of a doomed family, is testament to the writing. Composed with thick, purposeful prose, heavy on similie, metaphor and description, the novel charts the rise and fall of the Loftis Family, an archetypal rendering of the Soutnern Gentry. We follow the tragic downfall of Milton, the drunken patriarch, Ellen, the frigid mother, and the two Loftis daughters, one born perfect, one born crippled. It is a novel of abundant ontological truth, which will reach in and strangle the unconscious sensibilities of almost any reader, regardless of background or predispotition. The novel's beauty ranks with the prose of Lawrence, the passion of Rimbaud and Kundera, the depth and spiritual metaphysics of Doestoyevsky; It is both story and case study. And ultimately we are shepherded through tragedy after tragedy into the climax--the suicide of the immeasurably beautiful and desired Peyton Loftis--as we walk moment to moment with her, peering inside the poisoned stream of consciousness that overwhelms and eventually claims her. Lie Down In Darkness belongs in the canon of Great American Masterpieces. It's significance has only begun to be understood.",1

(It was as blast!) Because it was our first time and we were essentially clueless to the Disney experience, we bought several guides.The Unofficial Guide by Bob Sehlinger is the one book that I kept returning to over and over again. It's full of such detailed information that even the clueless will be prepared to visit Disney World. However, *because* this book provides an incredible amount of information (such as how to increase your chances for getting into the Hot Seat for MGM's Millionaire game), it could be almost overwhelming for first time visitors to Disney World. (I often got headaches trying to absorb everything!)In this book, you'll find a Crowd-Level Calendar, Park Traffic Patterns, Clip-Out Touring Plans, and much, much more. This book is updated yearly, so the 2006 version had information on Mickey's PhilharMagic, Expedition Everest, Lights, Motors, Action! Stunt Show, and so on.Reader feedback is peppered throughout the book, as is the critical and often snarky comments by the author. He provides fascinating ""behind the scenes"" facts, too. For example, the Imagineers of Mickey's PhilharMagic thought they were being clever when they released Jasmine's deodorant scent when she flies by on the carpet. However, many people were allergic to the scent (the show was often disrupted by sneezing!) so they pulled it from the show. Another amusing behind the scenes: Disney cast members sometimes mess with the Hall of Presidents to reflect current events (e.g., during the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal, the Prez had a condom sticking out of his jacket pocket.)As you can see, the author can be irreverent.Each attraction gets a thorough overview, as do the restaurants and hotels. For example, a phone number to each restaurant is provided, as is an evaluation of friendliness, service, wine slection, description of setting and atmosphere, menu samples/house specialities, hours of operation, and more. Although a few of the evaluations didn't jive with my experience (for example, the author raves about the Muppet 3D pre-show and movie whereas I thought it was suprisingly boring), there's enough information provided to at least get an idea if a restaurant or attraction would likely appeal. In fact, their star-system rating according to age (grade school vs. young adults vs. those over 30 etc.) is invaluable--and mostly correlated with my experience with the attractions.I found myself returing to the Unofficial Guide over and over again. In fact, it's the only guide I took WITH me to Disney World! Although I sometimes felt overwhelmed at all the information (it's hard for a newbie to take in all that Disney World offers, especially sight-unseen), I felt PREPARED due in large part to this book.The author is THOROUGH on his updates--including which attractions have been discontinued and the new ones to be introduced--so I know that the 2007 guide will be just as awesome as the 2006 version! (By the way, that's a picture of Expedition Everest on the 2007 cover--the new rollercoaster in Animal Kingdom that debuted in April of 2006. Here's a tip for ya: it's not HALF as scary--or fun--as people have said. I enjoyed Thunder Mountain Railroad at Magic Kingdom much more! The wait in the heat wasn't worth it for the Expedition ride, IMO, but we did get a pretty funny picture of the family when the Yeti makes an appearance!)Another great book you may want to get--and, unlike the Unofficial Guide, it has hundreds of color photographs--is the The Complete Guide to Walt Disney World which was just published in April of 2007. A second edition of that book will be published at the end of 2007.",1

The Greatest Sedition Is Silence: Four Years in America,"'Passionate, informed, important: William Rivers Pitt helps us see what's wrong with American politics today. This book is a call to arms for anyone who believes the US is charting a deadly course.' --Greg Palast, journalist",['William Rivers Pitt'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SmKGAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=SmKGAAAAMAAJ&q=The+Greatest+Sedition+Is+Silence:+Four+Years+in+America&dq=The+Greatest+Sedition+Is+Silence:+Four+Years+in+America&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Pluto Press (UK),2003-05-20,http://books.google.com/books?id=SmKGAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Greatest+Sedition+Is+Silence:+Four+Years+in+America&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],,0745320104,28.49,A1S60W4KWFX1Y9,William Podmore,96/103,5.0,1053302400,Riveting account of corruption in the USA,"This fascinating book reveals many extraordinary facts about present-day America, most importantly about its current war on terrorism. An Executive Order signed by Bush authorised secret military tribunals to try suspected terrorists: US citizens can be arrested and held without charge, without access to a lawyer, without trial and without limit. The Attorney-General says that those who oppose these tribunals are aiding the terrorists: dissent equals treason and terrorism!&#65533;Capitalism ... has discovered a fatal cancer in its guts.&#65533; Deregulation allowed &#65533;asset-stripping&#65533; (theft), as at Enron. There is much evidence of Bush and Cheney doing the same. As Pitt writes, &#65533;the pirates have seized this ship of state, and have two of their own at the helm.&#65533;The core of the book is a riveting account of the provenance of 9/11. From January 2001 to August, Bush held talks with the Taliban government in Afghanistan to get them to agree to Unocal&#65533;s proposed pipeline from Turkmenistan through Afghanistan to Pakistan. The Taliban rejected the deal. The Bush administration then threatened them with war, while watering down anti-terrorism measures. Before 9/11, Israel, Russia, Egypt, France and Germany had all specifically warned US security agencies of imminent terrorist attacks using hijacked airplanes against US landmarks. The Bush administration did not pass these warnings on to airport security agencies. When this was revealed, Bush responded that he did not order heightened airplane security because it would have cut industry profits!Stanley Hilton, a former aide to Republican Senator Bob Dole, charges that Bush allowed 9/11 to happen on purpose, so that he could make political gains from the tragedy. Bush has consistently refused to allow a public inquiry into the events surrounding 9/11, and last November he signed an Executive Order sealing all presidential documentation. After 9/11, US forces replaced the Taliban with a government friendly to the USA and its oil interests: Afghanistan is now, nominally, run by Unocal&#65533;s man on the spot.Saudi Arabia is the USA&#65533;s key ally in the Middle East, supplier of most of the USA&#65533;s oil and of 80% of Al Qa&#65533;ida&#65533;s recruits, and chief funder and sponsor of Al Qa&#65533;ida. Yet Cuba is part of Bush&#65533;s &#65533;Axis of Evil&#65533;, and Saudi Arabia is not! The CIA did not investigate the roots of Al Qa&#65533;ida terrorism in Saudi Arabia because this could have harmed US oil companies&#65533; interests. As John O&#65533;Neill, Deputy Director of the FBI before he resigned in protest, said, &#65533; The main obstacles to investigating Islamic terrorism were US oil corporate interests, and the role played by Saudi Arabia in it.&#65533; (Incidentally, George Bush Senior is on the advisory board of the Carlyle Group, a huge multinational heavily involved in the oil business.) Pitt writes, &#65533;a blind spot developed in our anti-terrorism preparations out of deference to these business interests.&#65533; The USA has now withdrawn its troops from the very country where it should be focusing its war on terror.On 16 May 2002, the Boston Globe revealed that the CIA had warned Bush months before 9/11 that Al Qa&#65533;ida planned to hijack planes. Four days later, on 20 May, the government issued warnings of more terrorist threats: Donald Rumsfeld, for example, said that terrorists would definitely use nuclear or biological weapons in the USA. The next day, 21 May, the Toronto Globe and Mail reported, &#65533;the White House acknowledged that the threats are not urgent and that they are partly motivated by political objectives. ... the blunt warnings issued yesterday and Sunday do not reflect a dramatic increase in threatening information but rather a desire to fend off criticism from the Democrats.&#65533; In Britain, we too have been lied to about fictitious threats to our national security. How could anything be more irresponsible than to play politics with national security and people&#65533;s fears?",1

Let me respond briefly to the fundamentalist (rousaswgnr) in Campsville, CA and the leftist bigot in Vancouver, WA. Both fail to scratch the surface of the book for opposite reasons.The reviewer in Campsville (rousaswgnr) apparently thinks that any appeal to right and wrong that doesn't simply quote Bible verses is anti-Christian. Obviously, he would be completely incapable of trying to convince nonChristians that there are universal moral laws that are contravened at our peril -- the very thing Lewis was trying to do. At one point this seeming &quot;fundamentalist&quot; wrote that only scripture teaches right and wrong and things about God. That statement is ironically contrary to scripture itself which says &quot;the heavens declare the glory of God&quot; and that God has revealled His ways and parts of His nature in nature itself and in human consciences (Romans 1). The reviewer rousaswgnr contradicts scripture while trying to defend it. That's a pity. For if he really understood scripture or C. S. Lewis he would know that Lewis is saying what scripture says: God has universal moral laws that He has written into nature that all people can see and that have been generally recognized by major civilizations throughout the ages. Lewis also says it with breath-taking beauty.The leftist from Vancouver, WA is even more vacuous than the fundamentalist. (That's typical.) Like the typical leftist, he imagines that he's brilliant while proving that he doesn't have a clue. He thinks he's clever by quoting Lau Tzu on the meaning of &quot;Tao.&quot; But if he'd bothered to have really read Lewis or found out the meaning of the Chinese word &quot;Tao&quot;, he would know that Lewis was not referring to Taoism but to the much more pervasive use of the idea of &quot;Tao&quot; in Chinese culture: that offered by Confucianism. The humanist from Vancouver, WA condemns Lewis for not getting it because he assumes that anyone who disagrees with his leftist ideology is empty-headed. His mindless repitition of Marxist ideology -- that moral systems are the mere fronts for political powers -- shows he's the one who hasn't understood Lewis. The Vancouver, WA leftist's statement that Lewis is merely defending &quot;western&quot; morals is absurd to the point of questioning whether he actually read the book -- or whether he's capable of really reading anything that isn't pre-committed to his Marxist politics. Indeed, the Vancouver leftist demonstrates that he's one of those men without chests about whom Lewis is writing while the fundamentalist from Campsville shows why modern conservative Christianity -- so frigthened of innovative communication -- has been so impotent, even though it holds the solution to the cultural problem Lewis diagnoses if only it could get over its reactionary anti-intellectualism and rigidity of mind that the reviewer exemplifies.",1

What Makes You Not a Buddhist,"An innovative meditation master cuts through common misconceptions about Buddhism, revealing what it truly means to walk the path of the Buddha So you think you're a Buddhist? Think again. Tibetan Buddhist master Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse, one of the most creative and innovative lamas teaching today, throws down the gauntlet to the Buddhist world, challenging common misconceptions, stereotypes, and fantasies. In What Makes You Not a Buddhist, Khyentse reviews the four core truths of the tradition, using them as a lens through which readers can examine their everyday lives. With wit and irony, he urges readers to move beyond the superficial trappings of Buddhism—beyond the romance with beads, incense, or exotic robes—straight to the heart of what the Buddha taught. Khyentse's provocative, non-traditional approach to Buddhism will resonate with students of all stripes and anyone eager to bring this ancient religious tradition into their 21st-century lives.",['Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QW8NquFBpdUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=QW8NquFBpdUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=What+Makes+You+Not+a+Buddhist&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Shambhala Publications,2008-08-12,http://books.google.com/books?id=QW8NquFBpdUC&dq=What+Makes+You+Not+a+Buddhist&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],7.0,1590304063,,A1K9KNLTSJF7Q9,Daiho,96/103,5.0,1169510400,What do Yoda and George Bush have to do with Buddhism?,"This is a wonderful little book, 130 pages of distilled wisdom from a man who is known most widely as a film maker, the director of The Cup, but who is otherwise a well-respected teacher from the Tibetan tradition of Buddhism. Besides being deeply familiar with Buddhist scholarship, Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse has traveled and worked widely in Europe and North America, knows the cultures of the countries, and is able to explicate Buddhist principles with examples that resonate for Star Wars fans and suburban American Republicans.The purpose of the book, the author notes, is not to make the reader a Buddhist, but to explain what it means to be a Buddhist. It's not a book about how to be, but a book about the implications of being. Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse does this through the Four Seals, truths about the physical, phenomenal, and psychological world that the Buddha himself invited his students to examine and investigate. They are:.....1. All compounded things are impermanent......2. All emotions are pain......3. All things have no inherent existence......4. Nirvana is beyond concepts.Each seal is discussed in separate chapters and illustrated with examples from contemporary life, as well as from the life of Siddhartha, the prince who gave up his pampered court life to seek greater truth and who later became known as The Buddha, the Enlightened One.Full of sharp humor directed at everyone from spiritual seekers to corporate suits, from tree huggers to neoconservatives occupying the White House, this witty volume is a pithy introduction to Buddhism and would make a great gift for any one interested in the philosophy. I've already purchased one volume for a friend and suspect I'll be buying a few more in the coming year.#",1

Focusing on the experiences of a fourteen-man platoon stationed on a Japanese-held island in the South Pacific during World War II, and written in a journalistic style, it tells the moving story of the soldiers' struggle to retain a sense of dignity amidst the horror of warfare, and to find a source of meaning in their lives amisdst the sounds and fury of battle.",['Norman Mailer'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=l4lZDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=l4lZDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Naked+and+the+Dead&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin UK,2018-11-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=l4lZDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],,089845140X,,A2MCOKNU34YR5Q,Andrew J.

She complains constantly about pain, and she's on about a half dozen medications. One day I asked her if she would ever consider stop feeding water to her dog. The obvious answer was &quot;no.&quot; I was waiting for her to ask further questions, but alas, nothing. That's the problem with human nature. We just don't get it sometimes. If a plant dies without water or even too little water, why do human beings not consume adequate water? If you don't consume adequate water, you might want to tell your friends you're on the &quot;slow suicide diet&quot; because that's what insufficient water intake is.As for the book, it was a little hard to read because it is technical and scientific. Much of the terminology was over my head, but a lot of the content was quite simple to understand in terms of how water affects food digestion, ulcers, our brain functions and so forth. Simply put, the author concludes that most disease and discomfort in the body is due to inadequate water intake. That's all. That sounds credible to me because I don't see any way the author could possibly make more money off his theories. He's not pushing food supplements or anything to sell. He's pushing water, and he even recommends tap water (no thanks).When I first read the book, I immediately increased my water intake. I started drinking one to two glasses of water at least one-half hour before each meal to prepare my digestive system. Within a day or two I noticed an immediate change in my digestion. No more &quot;brick&quot; feeling in my stomach all afternoon while my food digested oh so slowly.My only criticism of the book is that the author did not take into account that water can be ingested by eating fresh fruits and vegetables. He makes excellent points about how coffee, sodas and juices (canned) are not a substitute for water. There is no mention about fresh fruits and vegetables and the importance of consuming lots of these foods for their water content as well.I highly commend the author for this book. The part about salt intake really surprised me. I have always heard that salt is &quot;bad&quot; for the body, yet the author says the exact opposite and explains it in convincing detail. All I can say is that I need to read and reread the book to remind myself to consume water regularly.I'm giving this book five stars because it is worth it's weight in gold. It's mostly common sense mixed in with scientific and technical information which can be hard to follow at times unless you're into that stuff. I would be surprised if anyone read this book and was not convinced that drinking water was essential to health and well being.",1
Capitalism: A Treatise on Economics,"The theme of this book is the natural harmony of self-interests--of businessmen, wage earners, and consumers--under capitalism. It is based on an integration of the theories of the Austrian school and the doctrines of the British classical economists.",['George Reisman'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0QkVAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=0QkVAQAAMAAJ&q=Capitalism:+A+Treatise+on+Economics&dq=Capitalism:+A+Treatise+on+Economics&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Jameson Books (IL),1998,http://books.google.com/books?id=0QkVAQAAMAAJ&dq=Capitalism:+A+Treatise+on+Economics&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Business & Economics'],,0915463733,,A1UYTSIPGVUCDS,"Ingo Wechsung ""iw2163""",96/102,5.0,1012176000,"The ""Das Kapital"" of Liberalism","Capitalism, which appeared in 1998, is the life work of George Reisman, an economist unfortunately hardly known, who teaches at a private American university. This work can rightly lay claim to being one of the most comprehensive and intelligent defenses of capitalism that has ever been written. In over 1,000 closely printed pages, Prof. Reisman not only deals with all conceivable economic subjects, but places special value on demonstrating the errors of anti-capitalistic doctrines - from Marx, to Keynes, to the environmental movement. His foundation is, on the one side, the Austrian school, above all von Mises, with whom he studied, and, on the other side, the Objectivism of Ayn Rand, with whom Reisman was also acquainted and - together with Rothbard - debated. On this foundation he places a crystal clear, convincing structure of thought; in its totality a stirring plea for Laissez-Faire capitalism as the only system that is consistent with the nature of man and a free society. Rothbard and Reisman, incidentally, seem to have become estranged after their studies together. While in the case of Rothbard, to my knowledge, Reisman is never mentioned, Reisman in Capitalism shows Rothbard among others to have accepted the fundamental tenet of the Marxian exploitation theory, namely, that in reality the workers are the producers of goods.If Reisman deals with Rothbard this way, then one must not be surprised when he deals with the real anti-capitalists in such a devastating way that only tatters remain. All this without ever becoming abusive or polemical, for he is concerned with ideas, not persons. Drawing the conclusion that only irrational dolts could hold the erroneous doctrines just refuted is always left to the reader. And, indeed, I admit it, not a few chapters made me ashamed. I was ashamed of what nonsense I myself had partly believed, had partly simply never questioned. All the more, as after working through a chapter of Reisman's, everything seems very simple and logical. ""You too could have gotten there yourself if you had only thought for a moment,"" one says to oneself. Later the shame gives way to the good feeling of having mined an intellectual treasure.Reisman devotes special attention and its own chapter to the environmental movement, which he conceives as the ideological heirs of the socialists and for the present the most dangerous enemies. Socialism in its time set out as a movement which claimed reason and rationality for itself alone and proclaimed itself as the only scientific world view. After the catastrophic failure of the socialist experiment, this anticapitalistic movement did not inquire into the rational and economic causes of the failure, but preferred to throw reason as such overboard. The result was a green movement dangerous for freedom, which, for example, in all seriousness and partly with success, can declare inhospitable frozen wilderness in Alaska to be ""sacred ground, which must never be desecrated by oil derricks and pipelines.""In view of the new bugbear of the anti-globalization movement, this view seems to be out of date. Nevertheless, one will discover rather that the philosophical foundations of the environmental movement, which Reisman elaborates, appear much more open in the case of the enemies of globalization. Here they also erupt in concrete acts of violence, while in the case of the Greens they are rather obscured, present in the background. They include hatred of the free, productive human being, who applies his reason for the improvement of his condition and sees himself as well as his equals as the only instance constituting value. The anti-globalization scene uses indiscriminately the arsenals of socialists, statists, nationalists, and environmentalists in order to recommend to us mankind, state, nation, or mother earth, indeed, even ""animal rights"" as the highest, sacred values. The point being, ""my concerns shall never be my concern,"" as Stirner said.Politically, Reisman is an advocate of the minimal state. In the last chapter of Capitalism, titled ""Toward the Establishment of Laissez-Faire Capitalism,"" a strategy is outlined for achieving the minimal state. This is also certainly worth reading by those anarcho-capitalists who are realistic enough to seek the way to their ideal in the gradual weakening of the state. Hopefully, they will do so in common, up to a point in time who knows how remote, with the advocates of the minimal state.In short, the approximately 200 marks which I spent for Capitalism have been the best investment of my life in books. One cannot recommend the purchase only to people who enjoy reading the daily newspapers: after the reading of Capitalism, the fallacies of the untaught and the unteachable jump out at one in thick, fat letters, day in and day out-and not only out of the economics section.",1

We can't see the value of learning about the past, and applying its lessons to the present. We're arrogant enough with our vast wealth and power to believe that we invented everything first. Or we simply don't see the value of history, as a resource, as object lesson, as holding some answers to today's dilemmas.Brandeis University professor David Hackett Fischer acknowledges this blind spot and takes the long view in &quot;The Great Wave.&quot; Utilizing a very long telescope, one that sees back as far as the Dark Ages, Fischer investigates the history of price changes to expound on a fascinating theory that can possibly foretell nothing less than the future of the United States, whether we're headed for an era of greater prosperity, or a catastrophe like that of the Great Depression.Fischer's long-view theme is similar to more popular and populist works that spring up like daffodils and last about as long: Toffler's &quot;Fourth Wave&quot; and &quot;Future Shock&quot; easily come to mind, and politicians have their favorite advocates of either the &quot;future's so bright we got to wear shades&quot; school of eternal optimism, or the &quot;hunker down, boys, the Japanese / Germans / Latinos / big business / lower classes are coming over the walls&quot; school.The theory behind &quot;The Great Wave,&quot; in contrast, is the real thing, backed by solid research, not the author's political leanings. By examining the prices people paid for goods throughout history, four &quot;price revolutions&quot; were identified, each followed by a long period when prices were relatively stable. The intensity and length of each revolution was different, lasting as short as 80 years, to as long as 180 years.What provides the kick behind this notion is how this series of rising and fallings have had on the growth of society. In general, rising prices placed severe stresses on society at large. During the first three upticks (during the Medieval, 16th century and 18th century periods), bad weather added to the troubles by destroying harvests, leading to widespread starvation. The lower classes, squeezed between prices for basic foods they could no longer pay, as well as laws passed by the wealthy classes who wished to protect their investments, lead to catastrophes such as social revolution or a population-reducing plague. That would restabilize prices and, in general, give everybody a chance to catch their breath.Once the shocks of the collapse have passed, the society finds that prices have stabilized, and the population at large begins to recover. When times are good, the population tends to increase. This places stresses on food and fuel, triggering inflation. Continued prosperity increases the cycle of growth and demand, and added to the troubles are the occasional wars, when ambitious people felt comfortable enough with the status quo to demand more of it.This is a simplistic rendering in a review of what is actually a rather simple theory to understand in practice. Fischer tells the story of each wave, and the cause-and-effect patterns are so clear that it seems like one is reading the same story four times, with only the names of the players changed.Fischer's book looks intimidating at first. Its 536 pages is studded with charts showing the fluctuation of prices throughout history. But Fischer devotes only 258 pages to an analysis of prices waves; the rest of the book is taken up with appendices and essays on side issues. And the 258 pages contains 105 charts, further reducing the amount of reading needed to grasp the main points.Economics has been called the dismal science, but Fischer's work offers a cautionary story that is readily understandable and surprisingly compelling to the general reader. Where Fischer says we are on the next wave, I'll leave to those willing to make the effort. &quot;The Great Wave&quot; is well worth the journey.",0
The charioteer,,,,,,,,,,B0006AVZLM,,A8F2AZWB20X1H,JLind555,96/101,5.0,1035849600,A timeless love story,"Reading this book as a heterosexual female, I can't say that I identified with any of the characters; but Mary Renault has written a remarkable book that explores the issue of love from various sides and gives us an in-depth view of a people coming to terms with their own sexuality and what it will mean for them in the world at large.The time is 1940 and the place is England just after the retreat from Dunkirk; in the memorable words of Winston Churchill, it was their finest hour. At the center of the book is Laurie Odell, wounded in action, waking up in a military hospital to the fact that he will be crippled for life. The problem for Laurie is that he fears being emotionally crippled as well. Laurie is a graduate of a rigid British prep school where the head boy, Ralph Lanyon, was the object of his hero worship; Ralph is kicked out in a sensational scandal involving a hysterical accusation of homosexual activity with another boy in the school. Laurie is sexually attracted to Ralph and when Ralph is expelled, he realizes that the attraction was mutual, but that Ralph never approached him because he knew better than Laurie himself did that Laurie hadn't awakened to his own sexual orientation yet, and Ralph was not about to take that responsibility for him. While recuperating in the hospital, Laurie meets Andrew, a young conscientious objector who looks up to him as Laurie had looked up to Ralph. Andrew, however, is a total innocent, and his uncompromising religious views would make him look upon homosexual love as an abomination, even while he is attracted to Laurie. While on leave from the hospital, Laurie runs into Ralph, whom he hadn't seen since he was expelled from prep school seven years earlier, and learns that it was Ralph who piloted the navy boat that rescued him from Dunkirk. Ralph has been wounded as well, however, having had half his hand shot off, so the two of them are basically free and unfettered to start a relationship.Ralph has grown hard and cynical after seven years of searching for love with increasingly superficial partners, and he has hit rock bottom with his current partner, whose sole attraction is his dazzling good looks. The attraction between Ralph and Laurie is immediate and compelling, and throws Laurie into a dilemma: he can hook up with Ralph and face up to the fact of his homosexuality which he has been hiding from everyone, including himself; or he can remain on a platonic basis with Andrew and remain sexually frustrated. At the core of his problem is trying to resolve how one can be gay and maintain his integrity at the same time. After meeting some of Ralph's associates, he isn't so sure. Laurie doesn't want to be dragged into the gay milieu, and Ralph sees Laurie as his means of escape from that milieu, and the bottom line for them both is, are they homosexual men, or are they men who happen to be homosexual.Things get complicated when Laurie tells Ralph about Andrew (one of the things that attracts Ralph to Laurie is his fundamental honesty) and although he understands Laurie's dilemma, Ralph isn't about to let him off the hook; he tells Laurie that he has a choice: he can continue to help Andrew tell lies to himself about himself, or he can help Andrew face up to what he is. Laurie doesn't want that responsibility with Andrew any more than Ralph wanted it with him seven years earlier, and he temporizes until someone intervenes and Andrew has to face his own nature up close and personal. The resulting explosion shakes everyone up; Laurie finally realizes that being human ultimately means being true to oneself. What that means for Laurie is resolved at the end of the book.There are several interesting secondary characters in the story, including Alec, one of Ralph's previous partners, decent, honest, but unable to commit more than superfically, and Sandy, Alec's current partner, insecure, demanding, jealous, but also capable of love, and Bunny, Ralph's latest, despicable, devious, and totally amoral. But the three main characters are the most compelling: Andrew, whose rigid, unbending morality finally makes him snap; Ralph, hard, jaded, yet with a core of innocence and trust that still makes him believe that love is not a myth; and Laurie himself, trying to resolve who he is and what he stands for as a man and as a human being. For all its being a World War II story, the problems and issues are timeless and make the book as fresh today as it was 60 years ago when it was first issued. Mary Renault has shown with ""The Charioteer"" that she is not only a great historical novelist, she is one of the best writers of the 20th century.",1
The Essence of Chaos,"The study of chaotic systems has become a major scientific pursuit in recent years, shedding light on the apparently random behaviour observed in fields as diverse as climatology and mechanics. InThe Essence of Chaos Edward Lorenz, one of the founding fathers of Chaos and the originator of its seminal concept of the Butterfly Effect, presents his own landscape of our current understanding of the field. Lorenz presents everyday examples of chaotic behaviour, such as the toss of a coin, the pinball's path, the fall of a leaf, and explains in elementary mathematical strms how their essentially chaotic nature can be understood. His principal example involved the construction of a model of a board sliding down a ski slope. Through this model Lorenz illustrates chaotic phenomena and the related concepts of bifurcation and strange attractors. He also provides the context in which chaos can be related to the similarly emergent fields of nonlinearity, complexity and fractals. As an early pioneer of chaos, Lorenz also provides his own story of the human endeavour in developing this new field. He describes his initial encounters with chaos through his study of climate and introduces many of the personalities who contributed early breakthroughs. His seminal paper, ""Does the Flap of a Butterfly's Wing in Brazil Set Off a Tornado in Texas?"" is published for the first time.",['Flavio Lorenzelli'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CGm2IEWH894C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=CGm2IEWH894C&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Essence+of+Chaos&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,CRC Press,2003-09-02,http://books.google.com/books?id=CGm2IEWH894C&dq=The+Essence+of+Chaos&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Science'],2.0,B000PGJE8I,,A2V8WDJYG4MYXU,Whitfield,96/101,5.0,965692800,Excellent Chaos Primer,"My first intro to chaos was Gleick's book *Chaos: Making a New Science* which focused on the history of the discovery of chaos. Although this was fascinating - and a good read for those just learning about dynamical systems, strange attractors, and the like - Lorenz's *Essence of Chaos* was much more satisfying. Lorenz analyzes specific chaotic functions, gives you the math (equations are in the appendix) and generally accomplishes what the title suggests - that is, exploring the essence of chaos. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in this deeply fascinating subject.",1

The fact is, for the most part it's not s.o.c. at all. (See the Chicago Manual of Style, 10.45-10.47 and note the example they give...Joyce knew how to write s.o.c.). A better word for A Portrait is impressionistic. Joyce is more concerned with giving the reader an impression of Stephen's experience than with emptying the contents of his head. What's confusing is the style mirrors the way Stephen interprets his experiences at the time, according to the level of his mental development.When Stephen is a baby, you get only what comes in through the five senses. When he is a young boy, you get the experience refracted through a prism of many things: his illness (for those who've read Ulysses, here is the beginning of Stephen's hydrophobia - ""How cold and slimy the water had been! A fellow had once seen a big rat jump into the scum.""), his poor eyesight, the radically mixed signals he's been given about religion and politics (the Christmas meal), his unfair punishment, and maybe most important of all, his father's unusual expressions (growing up with phrases like, ""There's more cunning in one of those warts on his bald head than in a pack of jack foxes"" how could this kid become anything but a writer?)It is crucial to understand that Stephen's experiences are being given a certain inflection in this way when you come to the middle of the book and the sermon. You have to remember that Stephen has been far from a good Catholic boy. Among other things, he's been visting the brothels! The sermon hits him with a special intensity, so much so that it changes his life forever. Before it he's completely absorbed in the physical: food, sex, etc. After it he becomes just as absorbed in the spiritual/aesthetic world. It's the sermon that really puts him on the track to becoming an artist. One reviewer called the sermon overwrought. Well, of course it's overwrought. That's the whole point. Read it with your sense of humor turned on and keep in mind that you're getting the sermon the way you get everything else in the book: through Stephen.After Stephen decides he doesn't want to be a priest, the idea of becoming an artist really starts to take hold. And when he sees the girl on the beach, his life is set for good. That scene has to be one of the most beautiful in all of literature. After that, Stephen develops his theory of esthetics with the help of Aristotle and Aquinas and we find ourselves moving from one conversation to another not unlike in Plato (each conversation with the appropriate inflection of college boy pomposity). In the end, Stephen asks his ""father"" to support him as he goes into the real world to create something. I like to think that this is an echo of the very first line in the book. The father, in one of many senses, is the moocow story. The story gave birth to Stephen's imagination and now it's the son's turn to create.This is such a rich and beautiful book. I suppose it's possible for people to ""get it"" and still not like it, but I really think if you read and re-read, and maybe do a little research, the book will open up to you the way it did to me.",0

Within a few weeks she died due to bloat because of the bad and/or nonexistant advice of this book. I then bought the Storey book on sheep and found the information on bloat that could have saved her life if it had been in the goat book.Additionally, the tone of Mr. Belanger's writing rubs me the wrong way, sounding somewhat condescending at times and cavalier at others. I was disturbed by some of the things he recommended, such as transporting an adult goat by sticking it in the trunk of a car (!!!), but his attitude is that those who disagree with him are either ignorant or they're whiners. I am neither, and I don't appreciate paying good money to be told I am because I disagree, thankyouverymuch.In conclusion, this book does have its merits and is good for the basics, but it's not a complete source of information and I would get at least one other goat book as well as the Storey sheep book to fill out your library, especially if your large animal vet is very far away from your goats.",0
The Charioteer,,,,,,,,,,9999589502,,A8F2AZWB20X1H,JLind555,96/101,5.0,1035849600,A timeless love story,"Reading this book as a heterosexual female, I can't say that I identified with any of the characters; but Mary Renault has written a remarkable book that explores the issue of love from various sides and gives us an in-depth view of a people coming to terms with their own sexuality and what it will mean for them in the world at large.The time is 1940 and the place is England just after the retreat from Dunkirk; in the memorable words of Winston Churchill, it was their finest hour. At the center of the book is Laurie Odell, wounded in action, waking up in a military hospital to the fact that he will be crippled for life. The problem for Laurie is that he fears being emotionally crippled as well. Laurie is a graduate of a rigid British prep school where the head boy, Ralph Lanyon, was the object of his hero worship; Ralph is kicked out in a sensational scandal involving a hysterical accusation of homosexual activity with another boy in the school. Laurie is sexually attracted to Ralph and when Ralph is expelled, he realizes that the attraction was mutual, but that Ralph never approached him because he knew better than Laurie himself did that Laurie hadn't awakened to his own sexual orientation yet, and Ralph was not about to take that responsibility for him. While recuperating in the hospital, Laurie meets Andrew, a young conscientious objector who looks up to him as Laurie had looked up to Ralph. Andrew, however, is a total innocent, and his uncompromising religious views would make him look upon homosexual love as an abomination, even while he is attracted to Laurie. While on leave from the hospital, Laurie runs into Ralph, whom he hadn't seen since he was expelled from prep school seven years earlier, and learns that it was Ralph who piloted the navy boat that rescued him from Dunkirk. Ralph has been wounded as well, however, having had half his hand shot off, so the two of them are basically free and unfettered to start a relationship.Ralph has grown hard and cynical after seven years of searching for love with increasingly superficial partners, and he has hit rock bottom with his current partner, whose sole attraction is his dazzling good looks. The attraction between Ralph and Laurie is immediate and compelling, and throws Laurie into a dilemma: he can hook up with Ralph and face up to the fact of his homosexuality which he has been hiding from everyone, including himself; or he can remain on a platonic basis with Andrew and remain sexually frustrated. At the core of his problem is trying to resolve how one can be gay and maintain his integrity at the same time. After meeting some of Ralph's associates, he isn't so sure. Laurie doesn't want to be dragged into the gay milieu, and Ralph sees Laurie as his means of escape from that milieu, and the bottom line for them both is, are they homosexual men, or are they men who happen to be homosexual.Things get complicated when Laurie tells Ralph about Andrew (one of the things that attracts Ralph to Laurie is his fundamental honesty) and although he understands Laurie's dilemma, Ralph isn't about to let him off the hook; he tells Laurie that he has a choice: he can continue to help Andrew tell lies to himself about himself, or he can help Andrew face up to what he is. Laurie doesn't want that responsibility with Andrew any more than Ralph wanted it with him seven years earlier, and he temporizes until someone intervenes and Andrew has to face his own nature up close and personal. The resulting explosion shakes everyone up; Laurie finally realizes that being human ultimately means being true to oneself. What that means for Laurie is resolved at the end of the book.There are several interesting secondary characters in the story, including Alec, one of Ralph's previous partners, decent, honest, but unable to commit more than superfically, and Sandy, Alec's current partner, insecure, demanding, jealous, but also capable of love, and Bunny, Ralph's latest, despicable, devious, and totally amoral. But the three main characters are the most compelling: Andrew, whose rigid, unbending morality finally makes him snap; Ralph, hard, jaded, yet with a core of innocence and trust that still makes him believe that love is not a myth; and Laurie himself, trying to resolve who he is and what he stands for as a man and as a human being. For all its being a World War II story, the problems and issues are timeless and make the book as fresh today as it was 60 years ago when it was first issued. Mary Renault has shown with ""The Charioteer"" that she is not only a great historical novelist, she is one of the best writers of the 20th century.",1
Stranger in a Strange Land,"The original uncut edition of STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND by Hugo Award winner Robert A Heinlein - one of the most beloved, celebrated science-fiction novels of all time. Epic, ambitious and entertaining, STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND caused controversy and uproar when it was first published and is still topical and challenging today. Twenty-five years ago, the first manned mission to Mars was lost, and all hands presumed dead. But someone survived... Born on the doomed spaceship and raised by the Martians who saved his life, Valentine Michael Smith has never seen a human being until the day a second expedition to Mars discovers him. Upon his return to Earth, a young nurse named Jill Boardman sneaks into Smith's hospital room and shares a glass of water with him, a simple act for her but a sacred ritual on Mars. Now, connected by an incredible bond, Smith, Jill and a writer named Jubal must fight to protect a right we all take for granted: the right to love.",['Robert A.

I won't go into details (you can find them easily on the net) but essentially the cut down version is not written in Heinlein's ""voice"" but drastically cut down (by RAH) to fit into a length the publisher thought proper.And so it does not sound like any other Heinlein novel, and this has split the ""Stranger"" camp right down the middle. There are those to whom the original book was bible -- and those tend not to like other Heinlein works. Those of us who love Heinlein have always felt kind of ""meh"" about Stranger... until the uncut version was released (in 1991).Now, the Kindle version being sold is the cut version, so if you were a fan of that (published in 1961) you'll love this version. However, if you are not a huge fan of that version I would stay away from this Kindle version at all costs (there are easily found web versions of the uncut novel -- I'm not advocating piracy, but it's unlikely we'll ever see a Kindle uncut version as Amazon seems clueless here -- even official reviewers seem to think this version is uncut, but I can promise you it isn't, as the passages are clear and easy to find in even the sample version).One last thing -- if you have read the cut version (either this Kindle version or otherwise) you might want to give the uncut version a try. Also, if you are new to Heinlein and want to know what all the fuss is about, definitely read the uncut version. Watered down beer tastes just like that.",1
Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.,"“Csikszentmihalyi arrives at an insight that many of us can intuitively grasp, despite our insistent (and culturally supported) denial of this truth. That is, it is not what happens to us that determines our happiness, but the manner in which we make sense of that reality. . . . The manner in which Csikszentmihalyi integrates research on consciousness, personal psychology and spirituality is illuminating.” —Los Angeles Times Book Review The bestselling classic that holds the key to unlocking meaning, creativity, peak performance, and true happiness. Legendary psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's famous investigations of ""optimal experience"" have revealed that what makes an experience genuinely satisfying is a state of consciousness called flow. During flow, people typically experience deep enjoyment, creativity, and a total involvement with life. In this new edition of his groundbreaking classic work, Csikszentmihalyi (""the leading researcher into ‘flow states’"" —Newsweek) demonstrates the ways this positive state can be controlled, not just left to chance. Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience teaches how, by ordering the information that enters our consciousness, we can discover true happiness, unlock our potential, and greatly improve the quality of our lives.",['Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QVjPsd1UukEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=QVjPsd1UukEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Flow:+The+Psychology+of+Optimal+Experience.&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Harper Collins,2009-10-13,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QVjPsd1UukEC&source=gbs_api,['Psychology'],1404.0,B000NGX5A8,,AOLI9GI6DVK2Y,"Larry Mullins ""Larry Mullins""",96/101,5.0,1230768000,Valuable Insights into the Mystery of Happiness,"Flow are those inexplicable moments of indescribable happiness that we experience at rare intervals, when we are ""surprised by joy."" These precious moments seem to be gifts, almost accidental peak experiences in which life seems rich with meaning, joy and wonder. When and why do these magic episodes intrude upon our humdrum existences? Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's answer may surprise you: ""Contrary to what we usually believe, moments like these, the best moments of our lives, are not the passive, receptive, relaxing times ... The best moments of our lives usually occur when a person's body or mind is stretched to the limits in a voluntary moment to achieve something difficult and worthwhile. Optimal experience is thus something we make happen ... For each person there are thousands of opportunities, challenges to expand ourselves.""Csikszentmihalyi's theme is happiness. This philosopher-psychologist points out the Aristotelian concept that all other things we seek, riches, fame, power, etc. are valued only because we believe they will make us happy. Based upon decades of research on the mystery of happiness, Csikszentmihalyi defines it as moments of self-forgetfulness when we are totally absorbed in the process of life ... intervals of peak creativity and self-expression. He expands upon the research of Abraham Maslow and agrees that peak experiences are within the reach of us all. The theme of this book is the introduction of techniques to make this glad to be alive feeling occur more often. It may be stated that this book is no self-help step-by-step program, nor could it be. Each of us is plowing new snow, creating a path that no one else has traveled. The guidelines and the principles are here, but the journey into the sublime uncertainty of our destiny is individual and precious. Flow is one of several extraordinary contributions by this great mind.",1

It includes translations of selected Buddhist texts and a glossary of Buddhist vocabulary.When I first read ""What the Buddha Taught"" in college, it helped spark my interest in Buddhist practice, and one bit in particular has fundamentally shaped my approach to life and religion (Christianity as well as Buddhism): the story of the man wounded by a poisoned arrow, a parable illustrating the Buddha's utter noninterest in metaphysical speculation and his pragmatic and compassionate focus on liberation from suffering.I'd also recommend ""Awakening the Buddha Within,"" an introduction to Buddhist teachings by Lama Surya Das, an American teacher of Tibetan Buddhism.

Venture Capital and Private Equity: A Casebook (v. 3),"What Explains the Recent Tremendous Growth in Private Equity Funds? How Have These Funds Created so Much Value? Can We Expect This Kind of Growth in Other Countries and Other Types of Investments? The pool of U.S. private equity funds has grown from $5 billion in 1980 to over $175 billion in 1999. Private equity's recent growth has outstripped that of almost every class of financial product. Whether you are an entrepreneur seeking private equity finance, a private equity investor grappling with the industry's changes, or an investor interested in private equity as a potential investment, this book is required reading! It presents a collection of real world cases-supplemented by detailed industry notes-that explore the exciting and dynamic world of venture capital and buyout funds. The organization mirrors that of the venture capital/private equity process itself: * The first part explores the raising and structuring of private equity funds, as well as the perspective of investors. * The second part explores the selection,oversight, and adding value to firms-the 'heart' of the private equity cycle. * The third part describes how private equity groups reap attractive returns from successful investments. * The final section explores the emerging efforts to translate the private equity model into other settings, such as corporate venturing programs.",['Josh Lerner'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5GhaAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=5GhaAAAAYAAJ&q=Venture+Capital+and+Private+Equity:+A+Casebook+(v.+3)&dq=Venture+Capital+and+Private+Equity:+A+Casebook+(v.+3)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,2000,http://books.google.com/books?id=5GhaAAAAYAAJ&dq=Venture+Capital+and+Private+Equity:+A+Casebook+(v.+3)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Business & Economics'],,0471230693,,A3S3PYRW5ZG9K2,Unsatisfied,96/101,5.0,975196800,Perhaps the only book available on the subject matter,"Over the past few years the institutional private equity market has exploded. Riding on the backs phenomenal public markets and a wave of technological innovation, private equity in general and venture capital has become one of the most sought after investments.However, given the rash of recent publicity, stellar performance, and a balooning assets, there's surprisingly little research available about the institutional private equity market. Profs. Lerner and Gompers currently account for probably half of all academic research in this market.The institutional private equity market is quite different from angel investments. The majority of the capital at the institutional level flows from large investment institutions like public pensions, endowments and insurance companies. Moreover, the personal investing into private companies do so professionally.More than anything, the book serves as a primer to the institutional private equity market.The book was intitially meant for HBS and other MBA students. Thus, almost all the content is in case study form. In a lot of respects this is advantageous. In general, a book either has the option of being a primer or providing high level analysis on a very specific topic. Clearly this book is the former. In my opinion, the downfall of most primers are the oversimplification of topics and useless generalizations. Given the early stages of the institutional private equity market, generalizations are especially questionable and difficult. On the other hand, the case method presents users with numerous situations and predicaments facing the participants. As a result, readers gain an understanding of the issues facing this market from a number of perspectives.This books provides useful information on key topics such as investing and analyzing private equity funds from an institution's perspective, fund of funds, forming a private equity fund, and the direct investments into companies by the private equity funds, along with many other topics. Whatever level the private equity professional is functioning, understanding each of these components I imagine is key.This casebook provides an very good overview of the institutional private equity market.

"Story of a Soul: The Autobiography of St. Therese of Lisieux, Third Edition","Translated from the critical edition by John Clarke, OCD, 3rd ed. (1997). Includes Bibliography, general Index, and 11 photos. Two and a half years before her death in 1897 at the age of 24, as Thérèse Martin began writing down her childhood memories at the request of her blood sisters in the Lisieux Carmel, few could have guessed the eventual outcome. Yet this ""story of my soul,"" first published in 1898 in a highly edited version, quickly became a modern spiritual classic, read by millions and translated into dozens of languages around the world. Decades later, in response to growing requests from scholars and devotees of the Saint, a facsimile edition of the manuscripts appeared, along with more popular French editions of what the Saint had actually written.

Father John Clarke's acclaimed translation, first published in 1975 and now accepted as the standard throughout the English-speaking world, is a faithful and unaffected rendering of Thérèse's own words, from the original manuscripts.

The Oil Factor: Protect Yourself and Profit from the Coming Energy Crisis,,,,,,,,,,0446694061,,A2VIE4HE2D9W0T,Orson Wang,96/100,3.0,1092009600,Unevenly assembled concept; much practical investing advice,"""The Oil Factor"" is a comprehensive and practical investing book disguised in a misleading title. The book is best described as a very lengthy investment newsletter that describes how to use the price of oil to time major investment decisions.For a book with the word ""oil"" in the title, you expect discussion of concepts such as Hubbert's Peak and the state of current oil production. Mr. and Mrs. Leeb do not disappoint and present these topics in a way that is palatable to the uninitiated. However, this is not the main focus of the book.The main focus of the book is the use of a market timing indicator that they call ""the Oil Factor"". They describe a way to use the price of oil to predict the direction of the US economy and thus the direction of US stocks. The premise is that all economic activity in the US involves energy and the principle energy source is oil. It is an interesting idea and they have a decent amount of back-tested results to show how utilizing the Oil Factor to switch between the S&P; 500 index and Treasuries would have resulted in a doubling of your returns in the tested time period. This indicator is surprisingly simple and can be easily calculated and monitored by anyone. It is so simple, that it occupies only a single chapter to describe in full.The bulk of the book is subsequently used to present the case that the economy is in for hard times and investing strategies that will help you prosper. A surprisingly thorough treatment of the entire US Economy is presented. The book is an unexpectedly excellent summary of the bear's case for the next decade. The recommendations are surprisingly specific. Mr. and Mrs. Leeb name specific companies, believing strongly that their recommendations will stand the test of time that is demanded of books but not demanded of magazines and newsletters. Complete model portfolios are presented. They describe a model inflation portfolio for when the Oil Factor swings in one direction and a model deflation portfolio for when the Oil Factor swings in the opposite direction.The highly specific and pragmatic nature of the book will surely be a breath of fresh air for those accustomed to theoretical treatments, but very serious flaws of construction undermine the main thesis of the book.The first is that the Oil Factor is yet another simple mechanical method perfected through data mining. That is, they found something that correlates with market performance and have made the assumption that what worked over the past 30 years should work into the next decade. Suffice to say that out of countless models invented over the past century that utilize simple rules to outperform the market, none has ever stood the test of time. Some may remember the once popular ""Dogs of the Dow"", one of the more recent demonstrations of such a failure. I see no reason why the Oil Factor should survive and in fact see many reasons why it should fail. For example, the back-tested strategy uses only the past 30 years. The past 30 years excludes an enormously crucial factor clearly visible into the future: China. Strangely enough, Mr. and Mrs. Leeb discuss the enormous impact that industrializing China will have on the world's oil supplies, but neglect to discuss how this might influence the reliability of the Oil Factor, which has never seen a nation of 1 billion people pushing into the industrial age.A second serious flaw is that even if you accept the premise of the Oil Factor as a method of switching between stocks and cash, the authors then go on to argue that you should not use the Oil Factor to switch between stocks and cash, but rather to switch between an inflation portfolio and a deflation portfolio. They do not bother to backtest this strategy, but present only forward-looking fundamental arguments of why this should work in the future. It is a flaw stacked on top of a flaw.In summary the book is a poorly unified in concept. It should be noted, however, that the proposed deflation portfolio and inflation portfolio are excellent. Few people have arranged diverse asset classes under these banners. This alone makes the book worthwhile. If you believe that we are headed for inflationary or deflationary times, you may want to buy this book and skip to the last few chapters to find out what to buy.",1
Beyond the Highland Mist,"He would sell his warrior soul to possess her. . . . An alluring laird... He was known throughout the kingdom as Hawk, legendary predator of the battlefield and the boudoir. No woman could refuse his touch, but no woman ever stirred his heart—until a vengeful fairy tumbled Adrienne de Simone out of modern-day Seattle and into medieval Scotland. Captive in a century not her own, entirely too bold, too outspoken, she was an irresistible challenge to the sixteenth-century rogue. Coerced into a marriage with Hawk, Adrienne vowed to keep him at arm's length—but his sweet seduction played havoc with her resolve. A prisoner in time... She had a perfect ""no"" on her perfect lips for the notorious laird, but Hawk swore she would whisper his name with desire, begging for the passion he longed to ignite within her. Not even the barriers of time and space would keep him from winning her love. Despite her uncertainty about following the promptings of her own passionate heart, Adrienne's reservations were no match for Hawk's determination to keep her by his side. . . .",['Karen Marie Moning'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ciU5I5_7wcgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=ciU5I5_7wcgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Beyond+the+Highland+Mist&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Dell,2009-11-04,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ciU5I5_7wcgC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],47.0,0440242169,,,,96/100,5.0,929145600,This is a book for lovers of romance!,"Karen Moning with Beyond the Highland Mist brings a romance novel back to Romance. I loved this book. The kind of novel romance readers thrive on. A book to curl up with and takes you away from the everyday. The characters were well developed, the struggle between the hero and heroine compelling and the added touch of fantasy makes Beyond the Highland Mist a story you can dream on. I found BTHM witty, funny and touching. Hawk is an example of the true alpha-male, so handsome, strong and masculine in every way, but with a past that makes him vulnerable. Adrienne is not only beautiful but strong and independent. Badly hurt in the present she finds it hard to trust in the past. The catalyst for conflict is an amazing character called Adam Black, beautiful but sinister. This book has it all. Fantasy, fun and drama. Karen Moning has created with words a mind painting of romance of old. This is her first book and I for one am eagerly looking forward to her next book.

This and the two preceding books she did with Tanya Bernard I have read though and through before I ever cooked out of them, just because they're fun! Sarah is also down to earth, and her books aren't preachy like other vegan books. No guilt trips here. Just good food. How good?Wow! Not only is this book full of many yummy general recipes, the deserts in this book are to die for. Yum! Sarah also tells us how to make our own faux meat from scratch, so no more having to buy the pricey stuff from the heath food store. 95% of the ingredients used are simple things every grocery store has, and when something even semi-exotic is used, a common counterpart that can be substituted is named. Most of the recipes make 4 small or 2 large helpings, and can be made in 20-30 minutes.

The Enneagram: A Christian Perspective,"In this new, general introduction to the Enneagram, Rohr and Ebert show that the Enneagram was developed in Egypt by the Desert Fathers and rediscoverd by a Francisican missionary to the Moslems at the turn of the 14th century.","['Richard Rohr', 'Andreas Ebert']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yvycAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=yvycAAAAMAAJ&q=The+Enneagram:+A+Christian+Perspective&dq=The+Enneagram:+A+Christian+Perspective&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Crossroad,2001,http://books.google.nl/books?id=yvycAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Enneagram:+A+Christian+Perspective&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],5.0,0824519507,11.73,A1J93EGDYK0IWA,"Patrick D.

It does a good job of explaining Enneagram theory and an excellent scholarly job of looking at the history of the Enneagram. In addition, its descriptions of the 9 Enneagram types are well done and insightful. Each of these sections also contains many interesting historical references to important figures and event in Christian history.I have read a lot of Enneagram books including some that were written from a Christian perspective. Within the Christian subset of books, I feel this one is ""hands down"" the very best. It is also in general agreement with Riso and Hudson, Helen Palmer and Sandra Maitri on the characteristics of the types. These are three of the biggest names in Enneagram study and each has a useful perspective to offer.Rohr sees the Enneagram as both a useful psychological and spiritual tool for self growth. Psychologists and spiritual directors will really appreciate his rigor and depth. Another Christian author who uses the Enneagram for spiritual direction is James Empereur. His book THE ENNEAGRAM AND SPIRITUAL DIRECTION is also quite good.If you are a psychologist you may also want a copy of PERSONALITY TYPES by Riso and Hudson. This book covers the 9 developmental levels of each type in detail and the associated psychological pathologies. For a general audience, THE WISDOM OF THE ENNEAGRAM by the same authors may be better because it has a more broad focus on theory and keeps the detail on each developmental level to a minimum.Another point worth mentioning is that this updating version of Rohr's DISCOVERING THE ENNEAGRAM (retitled) covers new discoveries about the history of the Enneagram. This includes its use and possible origins in Early Christianity. This section is well-researched and you can find a lot of good references here on the history of the Enneagram.",1
Linear Algebra Done Right,"This text for a second course in linear algebra, aimed at math majors and graduates, adopts a novel approach by banishing determinants to the end of the book and focusing on understanding the structure of linear operators on vector spaces. The author has taken unusual care to motivate concepts and to simplify proofs. For example, the book presents - without having defined determinants - a clean proof that every linear operator on a finite-dimensional complex vector space has an eigenvalue. The book starts by discussing vector spaces, linear independence, span, basics, and dimension. Students are introduced to inner-product spaces in the first half of the book and shortly thereafter to the finite- dimensional spectral theorem. A variety of interesting exercises in each chapter helps students understand and manipulate the objects of linear algebra. This second edition features new chapters on diagonal matrices, on linear functionals and adjoints, and on the spectral theorem; some sections, such as those on self-adjoint and normal operators, have been entirely rewritten; and hundreds of minor improvements have been made throughout the text.",['Sheldon Axler'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ovIYVIlithQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=ovIYVIlithQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Linear+Algebra+Done+Right&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Springer Science & Business Media,1997-07-18,http://books.google.com/books?id=ovIYVIlithQC&dq=Linear+Algebra+Done+Right&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Mathematics'],2.0,0387982582,,A3VD0BF7VHXKIP,Bob,95/99,4.0,1130803200,"Clean and elegant, but not quite what the doctor ordered","I have used this text for a beginning graduate course in linear algebra, mostly because I prefer its treatment of eigenvalues and eigenvectors over Hoffman and Kunze, and it sticks to the basics: complex scalars. It also has a good treatment of inner product spaces. The basic concepts and theorems are indeed presented cleanly and elegantly. Its use of linearly independent sequences (rather than sets) is a little nonstandard (what if the set of vectors is infinite?) but the adjustment is minor. Two things though I found treated in a less than desirable fashion: He pretends that we don't know about matrices, doesn't want to develop the machinery, and the treatment of coordinate vectors and matrix representations suffers. Students also get no sense of how to compute the solution of concrete vector space problems, which is easily done once the theory is established, and which is an essential skill to have after a second course in linear algebra. I have to give them supplementary notes. Second, the treatment of determinants suffers, apparently for ideological/political reasons. I think students deserve a straightforward development of determinants simply because that theory is widely used in applications, in engineering, and in discrete mathematics, and it has its own beauty. It is not hard to do, and I do it myself from notes, adapted from the treatment of Hoffman and Kunze. Now that undergraduate linear algebra courses have in many places dropped any substantial theorem-proving component, students need a serious course in linear algebra which can take them, e.g. all the way into Jordan form. There are not many good books for this, and this text does a good job with the basics without overkill on the abstraction, so I use it despite the drawbacks mentioned above.",1

It has a good discussion of hardware (cameras, etc.) and software (for editing and manipulating images). It also has a good discussion of approaches and techniques to taking photos. The book is extensively illustrated throughout with color photos and drawings, a real strength compared to most other books.My bias is that most people should focus more on taking good photographs - paying attention to lighting, exposure, composition, etc. - than on technology. It takes a lot of editing to fix a bad shot. So the fact that this is written by a photographer is another big plus (though he appears to do mostly coffee table books, rather than guides).A better book for some is Steve Bavister's Digital Photography. It's much clearer on the key fundamentals of photography. It has less detail all around, but that is a plus for those who want the main ideas quickly or looking for an accessible introduction. That's the book I bought for my teenage nephew; he's smart, but given his limited experience, I thought it better to give him a book with more emphasis on photography.Note that Freeman's book discusses technical aspects of hardware and software generically, not specific to any program, which may be a negative for those users looking for a step-by-step guide to their programs or software. Also, if you don't think you'll ever do more than resize or fix red-eye, the technical discussion may not be much use to you. OR, it may open your eyes to what can be done!Another set of alternatives, for a narrower group of users looking more for specifics on the technical aspects of hardware and software, are books like Long's Complete Digital Photography. But those books don't use photos and illustrations in the text, and are written by technical writers - not photographers. They emphasize the ""digital"" far more than the ""photography,"" and aren't good as an all-in-one first book.This is one of many books where the rating really depends on the fit to your needs.

Perskie ""ceruleana""",95/99,5.0,1123372800,"A work of great beauty, depth & an outstanding literary classic!","Powerful and moving, ""The Mill on the Floss"" is considered to be George Eliot's most autobiographical novel. Along with ""Middlemarch"" it is my favorite. Set in early 19th century England - St. Ogg's, Lincolnshire to be exact - this is the tale of gifted, free-spirited Maggie Tulliver and her selfish, spoiled brother, Tom, who were born and raised at Dorlcote Mill on the River Floss. Eliot's portrayal of sibling relationships is terribly poignant and plays a major part in the novel, as does the longstanding rivalry between two local families - the Tullivers and the Wakems.From earliest childhood Maggie worships her brother Tom, and longs to win his approval, and that of her parents. However, her fierce intelligence and strong streak of independence bring her into constant conflict with her family. She finds, in literature, the kindness and love she longs for in life. ""...everybody in the world seemed so hard and unkind to Maggie: there was no indulgence, no fondness, such as she imagined when she fashioned the world afresh in her own thoughts. In books there were people who were always agreeable or tender, and delighted to do things that made one happy, and who did not show their kindness by finding fault. The world outside the books was not a happy one Maggie felt. If life had no love in it, what else was there for Maggie?"" Her nature, complex, passionate, sensuous, noble, intellectualized, and spiritualized, is of great importance to this novel, as is the pathos of her relationship with Tom.Maggie's early years are brilliantly and unsentimentally portrayed from a child's perspective. The author structures a sequence of childhood's phases, which might appear, at first, to be random vignettes, but constitute an excellent psychological basis on which to build a character and motivation. Eliot once stated, ""my stories always grow out of my psychological conception of the dramatis personae."" Thus, the author chronicles Maggie's life as she grows from a precocious little girl to a strikingly attractive young woman, tall with full lips, and a ""crown"" of jet black hair. Her lack of social pretension makes her even more charming and likeable. As she matures, her conflicts with her brother, her family, even with her community, increase significantly. She, herself, feels torn between what is considered her ""moral responsibility"" and her search for self-fulfillment. Ultimately, she demonstrates honor and courage in the face of the disapproval of a narrow, tradition-bound society.Parallel to, and intertwined with Maggie's story, is that of families Tullivur and Wakem. After Tullivur loses his mill and social respectability through bankruptcy, (a loss precipitated by a rash lawsuit he undertook), Wakem purchases it all. Mr. Tullivur agrees to stay on as manager. At first he seems resigned to his misfortune. However, within the space of a few pages he is swearing vengeance on the new owner and cursing him. He actually summons Tom to inscribe his curse on Wakem in the family Bible, and makes his son swear to uphold it. The feud becomes violent when Wakem, in the role of proprietor, appropriately corrects Tullivur's management of the mill. Of course the criticism is taken as an insult, and shortly afterward, upon meeting his boss on the road, Tullivur horsewhips him in ""a frenzy of triumphant vengeance."" Tom sees this uncontrolled outbreak of madness as the result of long repressed hatred. Mr. Tullivur never repents his beating of Wakem. His injured pride and sense of righteous indignation, justify him in his own mind. This lack of forgiveness is also demonstrated by Tom for his sister. In direct contrast, Maggie couples love with forgiveness.As she reaches adulthood, Maggie finds herself torn between her relationships with three extremely different men: her proud, stubborn brother, Tom; Philip Wakem, a beloved friend who is also the son of her family's worst enemy; and a charismatic but unacceptable suitor. When Tom is thrown suddenly into the role of adult, after his father's death, he becomes obsessed with acquiring social status and power. He attempts to arrange a socially advantageous marriage for Maggie, and when she refuses, he severs ties with her.I won't spoil your read with any further discussion of the novel's details, especially the dramatic conclusion. George Eliot writes with a keen sense of humor, especially when addressing the grotesque in the human character. Her narrative has great depth, as insight to character and social observations are more important to Eliot than pace and action. ""The Mill On The Floss"" is deeply romantic - a work of great beauty and a literary classic. I cannot recommend it highly enough.""The Mill On The Floss"" is based partially on Eliot's, (born Mary Ann Evans), own experiences with her family and her brother Isaac, who was three years older than she. Eliot's father, like Mr. Tulliver, was a businessman who had married a woman from a higher social class. His wife's sisters were rich, ultra-respectable, and self-satisfied. These maternal aunts provided the character models for the aunts in the novel. Like Maggie, Eliot was extremely intelligent, energetic, imaginative and unconventional. She did not fit traditional models of feminine beauty or behavior, causing her family a great deal of consternation. Eliot lived with a man who she had not married - a daring enterprise in Victorian England. By the time this novel was published, she had gained considerable notoriety as an ""immoral woman.""In this edition writer and critic A. S. Byatt provides full explanatory notes and an Introduction further relating ""Mill On The Floss"" to George Eliot's own life and times.JANA",1
The Sorcerer's Crossing: A Woman's Journey (Compass),"Some twenty years ago, anthropologist Carlos Castaneda electrified millions of readers by describing his initiation--under the Yaqui Indian brujo Don Juan--into an alternate reality. Now Taisha Abelar, who was taught by the female members of Don Juan's group, recounts her own ""crossing"" in this arresting book. While traveling in Mexico, Abelar became involved with a group of sorcerers and began a rigorous physical and mental training process designed to enable her to breach the limits of ordinary perception. The Sorcerers Crossing details that process, giving us a highly practical sense of the responsibilities and perils that face a woman sorcerer. Abelar's enthralling story is invaluable as a virtual ""sorcerers manual"", as anthropology, and as a provocative work of women's spirituality.",['Taisha Abelar'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8INPEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=8INPEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Sorcerer%27s+Crossing:+A+Woman%27s+Journey+(Compass)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin,1993-11-01,http://books.google.com/books?id=8INPEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Sorcerer%27s+Crossing:+A+Woman%27s+Journey+(Compass)&hl=&source=gbs_api,"['Body, Mind & Spirit']",1.0,0140193669,10.42,,,95/99,5.0,950486400,Very practical perspective into the world of sorcery,"This is maybe the most practical book written about nagualism, as first described by Carlos Castaneda. It took me a long time to read this book, not because it was slow or dense, but because there are so many descriptions of practical exercises (often reminiscent of certain aspects of Tensegrity, but not always), that it took me five times as long to practice the maneuvers than to actually do the reading.That said, it is a very good book, even if you're not planning to recapitulate or anything like that. For people who haven't read any Castaneda, it will probably seem a little off-the-wall, especially given that Taisha Abelar doesn't really provide a wealth of explanations as to what she experienced -- only descriptions -- which is perhaps a sign of why Castaneda described her as such a stupendous stalker.This book is a good entry point into sorcery, especially so for women who have had a hard time getting into Castaneda, because of his inherently male bias. This book also works really well in conjunction with &quot;Being in Dreaming&quot; by Florinda Donner -- together, the two books cover the companion disciplines of stalking and dreaming.Finally, if you're serious about freeing up energy and breaking the barriers of perception, Taisha Abelar's book has the most detailed account of the recapitulation out of any of the related works. You'll learn a lot by listening to what she is told.",1
Excellent Women,"'I'm a huge fan of Barbara Pym' RICHARD OSMAN 'One of the most endearingly amusing English novels of the twentieth century' ALEXANDER McCALL SMITH Mildred Lathbury is one of those 'excellent women' who is often taken for granted. She is a godsend, 'capable of dealing with most of the stock situations of life - birth, marriage, death, the successful jumble sales, the garden fete spoilt by bad weather'. As such, she often gets herself embroiled in other people's lives - especially those of her glamorous new neighbours, the Napiers, whose marriage seems to be on the rocks. One cannot take sides in these matters, though it is tricky, especially as Mildred, teetering on the edge of spinsterhood, has a soft spot for dashing young Rockingham Napier.

Her truths are pungent a sexual revolution later.Relevancy aside, this is a good read. Pym lays out her well-defined world much as Jane Austen does, providing a critical and always witty tour. The characters are drawn as sharply as any Austen delivered. The novel is entertaining but rewardingly complex as it probes not only gender and social mores but also asks if Mildred Lathbury, the protagonist and narrator, is choosing the life of an excellent woman or if she is saddled with it. To use a contemporary phrase, it is about having a life, and this deceivingly gentle-seeming book is asking questions that are as rugged and significant as any asked in our less regulated times.",1
The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women,"INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER - Pulitzer Prize winning author presents the stories of a wide range of Muslim women in the Middle East. As an Australian American and an experienced foreign correspondent, Brooks' thoughtful analysis attempts to understand the precarious status of women in the wake of Islamic fundamentalism. ""Frank, enraging, and captivating."" - The New York Times Nine Parts of Desire is the story of Brooks' intrepid journey toward an understanding of the women behind the veils, and of the often contradictory political, religious, and cultural forces that shape their lives. Defying our stereotypes about the Muslim world, Brooks' acute analysis of the world's fastest growing religion deftly illustrates how Islam's holiest texts have been misused to justify repression of women, and how male pride and power have warped the original message of a once liberating faith. As a prizewinning foreign correspondent for The Wall Street Journal, Geraldine Brooks spent six years covering the Middle East through wars, insurrections, and the volcanic upheaval of resurgent fundamentalism.

The author is right about the sorry state of womens rights in Islamic countries. Her tone, while caustic, is entertaining and while I am a Muslim, I do not find it insulting at all. She is wrong on substantive areas of Islamic law. For example, she is woefully ignorant on divorce where the Maliki school allows divoce on the grounds of incompatability (contrary to her assertions). She also makes a great deal hinge on the age of the Prophets wife Aisha without even mentioning the controversy here (a comprehensive study by Pakistani Islamist scholars, Tehkik e Umar e Aisha, concludes she was 17 to 26 at the time of marriage). She does not search for truth and is only too ready to accept caricatures.All of this said, we Muslims need to think hard about her views as we create the surface perceptions she reflects. Rather than condemn her work, we need to ask outselves why we give others such impressions. In return outsides owe us to dig deeper for the truth.",1

In the Captains and the Kings some historical events described are the US civil war, the presidencies of Lincoln, labor struggles, the making of Teddy Roosevelt, and immigration.

I have never been a fan of socially conscious literature, and I anticipated a novel in the style of William Dean Howells - full of cardboard characters, most of whom would be down trodden and hopeless, or rich and ruthless, and enough moral pronouncements to make me feel guilty for at least a day or two. Thankfully, I let the Modern Library editors convince me that the book was worth reading.The novel is set during the dawning of the twentieth century and concerns itself with the impact of mechanical innovation on the bucolic life styles of a midwestern town. As the novel opens, the gulf between prominent families and their aristocratic lives are contrasted with those in society whose main purpose it is to support this luxurious and frivolous existence. The aristocracy is personified by the Amberson family, wealthy and prominent, and particularly by George Amberson Minafer, the spoiled grandson of the family's founder. He is unable to understand that a great revolution is taking place around him, that the lifestyle he has always known is soon to become anachronistic as those people with talent, luck and a little capital will soon surpass him in wealth and prestige. Although he has the talent to join this new mechanical age, he prefers to be and to remain a gentleman and to believe that ""being things"" is far superior to ""doing things.""As the midwestern town grows and expands and becomes more and more industrial, and even as the Amberson family compound becomes surrounded by apartment buildings and factories, George is unable to accept the fact that he and his family are becoming irrelevant. As the town quickly turns into a dirty and depressing city and the Amberson fortune begins to crumble, he still dresses for dinner, still drives a horse and cart, and still holds to his standards ""as a gentleman."" Tarkington weaves in subplots involving the love story of George's widowed mother and the Henry Ford-like Eugene Morgan as well as George's own romantic involvement with Morgan's daughter. These stories add a subtle ironic twist to the narrative as well as allowing the author to delve deeper into the consciouness of his spoiled (but sympathetic) antagonist.Although there is some of Howells influence in this book, Tarkington does not succumb to the artistic sterility of his mentor. This author is able to tell an interesting story and to develop characters that are not only realistic, but invoke an emotional response from the reader. And although the ending seems to me a little contrived and more in keeping with some of the ""realist"" writers of the early twentieth century, Tarkington's novel is, in the end, successful and offers an enjoyable reading experience.",1

Rondeau,95/98,4.0,1126828800,Gives New Meaning to the term DYSFUNCTIONAL family,"Most fans of historical novels love history, and as a result I'm sure most have some idea of the depravation that was inherent in the `Borgia' family line, especially that of one I'd always thought of as the most depraved - Lucrezia. Well, I admit to my ignorance. Though Lucrezia was far from innocent - her father, the very decadent Rodrigo Borgia aka POPE ALEXANDER VI and her brothers Juan and Cesare were the true monsters.The Borgia bride is a powerfully historical novel told in the first person from the point of view of Princess Sancha of Aragon, a young woman whose father would, for political reasons, marry her to one of the Pope's acknowledged sons, the youngest Borgia, Jofre. While Sancha was spoilt and pampered as the daughter of King Alfonso II of Naples, her worth was calculated only by what advantageous marriage could benefit her family, with no concern over happiness or love. Married to the youngest Borgia, Jofre, they were eventually summoned to Rome, by Jofre's father. It would be in Rome where Sancha met Cesare Borgia. From the moment their eyes met Sancha would finally come to understand passion and a line from Plutarch that she, had once mocked, "" I fear, yet hope; I burn, and I am ice."" Sancha would discover an all consuming passion falling hopelessly in love, but she would eventually see that passion turn to hatred as she came to see Cesare for the coldly calculating and depraved power hungry murderer that he was.*** This took me a long time to read; not so much for the length (500+ pages) but more so for the time I took to look up actual historical events, persons, and whether Sancha was real (or a figment of the authors imagination). It explores the tenuous friendship Sancha cultivated knowing how dangerous Lucrezia could be whose jealousy and possessiveness of her father's and brother's affection was legendary. While the story was set during a fascinating historical era of Italian and Papal history with the infamous Borgia family center stage, it provides a fascinating view of the decadence and what could be construed as a prime example of the term dysfunctional family. Did I like and enjoy this book? Yes, most definitely! It was fascinating and I would recommend it to any lover of historical books, but while there were some very graphic sexual encounters, it was not what I could term a romance novel.[...]",1

Like many of Dickens's works, Pickwick was published in monthly installments, or ""numbers"" as they were called then. Although Dickens originally intended to end the story at the twentieth number, the popularity of the series (and the resultant income) convinced Dickens to double the length to forty numbers. The end result is a large offering that'll take you a while to get through (~750 pages in the excellent Penguin edition, which I read).Despite its length, Pickwick never tries your patience. It's delightfully humorous from beginning to end. Samuel Pickwick is the bumbling, middle-aged, wealthy namesake of this novel. He's the leader of a small group of single men that gets into all sorts of mischief, both physical and social. Booze is rampant. Apparently liquor back then was much more a part of daily life than today; everywhere these guys go they party and get drunk. They get into trouble with the law, women, unsavory characters, and more.Characterization is superb. This is one of the few novels I've read for which I can actually say that I got to know the characters. In most books I've read, the characters remain two-dimensional and the plot is what carries the story. In Pickwick, the *characters* are the essence of the story and the novel wouldn't be memorable at all if a lesser author were attempting to breathe life into these people.The Penguin edition includes a decent collection of endnotes to help explain unfamiliar portions of the text. Nevertheless, there were still quite a few words and concepts peculiar to early 19th century England that I didn't grasp. This edition also has maps of southern England and a key to the specific locations that the Pickwickians visit. In addition, two appendices reprint some of the announcements and prefaces that Dickens wrote in relation to the work.Highly recommended, particularly if you enjoy classic literature! Dickens's later works overshadow this gem due to their maturity, but Pickwick beats them all in enthusiasm, humor, and wit.",1

How to Be Rich,Mr. Getty expounds the highly personal view of business that has guided him through his spectacular career. He reveals the principles and methods which have enabled him to build up and wisely use his tremendous fortune.,['Jean Paul Getty'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cpQXEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=cpQXEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=How+to+Be+Rich&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Jove Publications,1965,http://books.google.com/books?id=cpQXEAAAQBAJ&dq=How+to+Be+Rich&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Business & Economics'],1.0,B000MOOAWS,,A1KYWYU8MOD7ND,A Customer,95/98,5.0,895795200,Knowledge is Power. This book is full of Knowledge.,"This is not a book about how to get rich. As its title implies, it is a book about how to be rich. Accordingly, much of Getty's advice is directed toward the development of a particular state of mind rather than detailing a formula for monetary acquisition. Although Getty earned the basis of his mega-fortune as a wildcatter in the oilfields of California, Texas and Oklahoma, he was a highly-educated man. Following graduation from college in California, he attended Oxford University, earning a graduate degree there. Only after his return from England did he plunge into the enterprise of oil exploration and drilling that paid off so handsomely. Thus, Getty's book is not the one-dimensional tract so commonly written today by lesser intellects. He discusses what it means to be rich -- the attitudes, the appreciation for the cultural heritage of classical music, literature and art (The Getty museum in California, based on his original collections, is one of the largest repositories of fine art in the world today). He discusses how an individual's outlook and attitudes constitute a virtual program for either success or failure. Then he provides the intellectual tools for changing self-limiting habits and developing productive and beneficial ones. He provides practical advice and an expert evaluation of the various forms of investment. In recent years, we have seen sports figures, entertainers and lawsuit winners squander their fortunes. On the other hand, we have seen immigrants like those who escaped Castro's Cuba with nothing but their lives -- their entire life's work stolen by the communist thugs -- only to earn a second fortune in the US. Why is this? Because, having been rich, they knew how to be rich -- they had programmed themselves to be rich. Getty's book goes a long way toward imparting that information to its readers. Once in possession of Getty's guidance, however, the hard work of implementing it still lies ahead, but his book is a literary roadmap to success without peer.",1

Independent People: An Epic,"""An epic tale of a stubborn sheep farmer named Bjartur of Summerhouses who decides to spit in the direction of his country's pagan traditions, and its landowners, making his way alone.""--",['Halldor Laxness'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=A9D-DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=A9D-DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Independent+People:+An+Epic&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Everyman's Library,2020,http://books.google.com/books?id=A9D-DwAAQBAJ&dq=Independent+People:+An+Epic&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],54.0,B000HMDOEK,,,,95/98,5.0,934761600,"Bleak and Beautiful, an Astonishing Tale","Independent People is not a book for everyone. It is a long, slow and sometimes punishing read. Laxness paints the sheep farmer's life in bleak tones. Think of Solzhenitsyn's Siberia or Rolvaag's Dakota prairie. So dismal is the mood at times that the reader feels the imminent onset of seasonal affective disorder. But Independent People also contains moments of pure, distilled beauty so arresting they seem to stand out from the cold landscape like stars in the ink of darkness. Bjartur of Summerhouses is a true epic hero. As Monte Christo is to vengeance, Bjartur is to self-determination. His emotional intransigence and the suffering he visits on all those close to him is balanced only by the enormity and brute force of his will. Asta Sollilja, his daughter, is the only possible counterweight to his obstinacy, in both emotional and literary terms. She is strong and sensitive, beautiful and grotesque, half Bjartur, half anti-Bjartur. Her duality provides the story's central drama and the book's over-arching metaphor. Masterfully constructed of vignettes woven into small books, Independent People is seamless. Laxness's voice is clear and lyric, never showy. The writing is fresh and modern, yet seems to be channeled from Iceland's mythic past. This is a land populated by many dark spirits and one never feels quite free of their presence here. Certain images from Independent People are indelibly etched on my consciousness. A man violently and accidentally riding a reindeer. A girl longing by a window for a stranger she's met just once. A young man seduced back to the home he has left by a siren on horseback. There is something more to why I love this book. I spent a week in Iceland in July 1998, and was transfixed by its rugged, austere beauty. The feeling I had while reading Independent People was the same feeling that possessed me the entire time I was in Iceland. It was the cold, astonishing sensation of stepping outside your self and gazing on the topography of your own heart.",1

I waslooking forward to teaching from it.It is quite clear from the reviews though, that thereviewers have not **used** it for teaching; they mayhave browsed it at most.The first disappointments came very soon in the course Itaught. The biggest flaw of the book is the really bad stylein which the proofs are written. They manage to be seeminglyoverflowing with explanation, and at the same time difficultto understand. They gloss over many details: if the teachertries to skip these, an alert student could easily makehim/her look pretty silly.One case in point is the proof of the label correctingalgorithm's correctness starting on page 136. I knew thismaterial from before, so I thought preparing class fromhere would be a breeze. I was wrong: after going back tomy notes, and breaking up the mess into several simpleclaims did I manage to make notes from which I could teach.Whoever missed the class was helpless, when they lookedfor explanation in the book.I only remark, that all classes that I taught from this bookwere at some of the top 10 OR depts at the US... so this ishardly the students' fault.Many exercises are wrong as well, and although the authorsclaim that they will try to fix the mistakes, they hardly everreply to reader's comments, as some of my fellow professorstold me.I can only compare the style of the exposition to thelater written Combinatorial Optimization book byCunningham et. al. There is a WORLD of difference.One can try to look up for instance, the prooffor the label correcting algorithm: the proof in theAhuja et. al book is practically creaking at the joints,while in Cunningham et. al. it flows lucidly.I suspect that the authors of the latter book wrote it, sincethey were unhappy with this one; one can hardly be surprised.On the positive side, the plethora of applications presentedis truly amazing, and the exercises (when correct) are excellent.To sum it up: A good book, which could have become a great one,but have not; one which is very useful, but at thesame time very hard to use... I think the community would thankthe authors for a second, revised edition, that would fixall the mistakes, and all those terrible proofs.A final word: this text received the prestigious Lanchesterprize. One may surmise that giving prizes to a textbookwould be best done maybe after 5 years, after a book provedits worth in actual teaching in the trenches,so to speak, and NOT based on the first impression that thejury gets.",1

In addition, he felt that our schools did a very poor job of preparing young people for what life was all about. This book presented at least one partial solution to both problems: have a school course in survival, whose final test was to be dropped onto some unknown 'wilderness' planet for a week and forced to actually survive. Around this basic concept Heinlein fashioned what is probably one of the best of his so-called 'juvenile' novels.Roderick Walker is the prime character, a young man with some doubts about whether he is really ready to take the final exam in this course. With some encouragement and advice from his older sister, he decides to proceed, going through the 'gate' to a new world where nothing is familiar, where everything must be viewed as potentially deadly. But after managing to survive for the prescribed time, there is no pick up signal, no return gate, and Rod slowly comes to the conclusion that, regardless of what has gone wrong, he must make a go of really living long term on this new world. Along with other class survivors, a small society is formed, initially with Rod as the nominal leader.From this point, Heinlein manages to show the essentials of how and why a government is formed, what type of government make sense for a small group, how a society protects itself from 'bullies' (the only truly deadly animal is the two-legged variety), the contribution made by both sexes to a properly functioning society, just what makes a man a man, and the essential qualities of a leader. All buried within a fine adventure story of just how the little group builds itself from an unrelated bunch of people huddling in a cave to a bustling, forward looking industrious town, with excellent characterizations of not just Rod but most of the people around him, and with very little direct preaching, but rather showing his points as results of the events and actions of his characters.Heinlein's typical unforced, simple American prose style is much in evidence here, making both dialog and descriptions seem perfectly natural. This makes for a very fast reading experience, with a lot of his philosophical points sliding in under the reader's conscious radar, only to wake you up at 3AM with an 'Oh, yeah! That makes sense.' And perhaps you will come away from this book, as I did, thinking that the idea of a school course in survival is something that should actually be implemented.Everyone, from teens to adults, homemakers to rugged individualists, engineers to social workers, can enjoy this book. There are very few works that can appeal to such a wide range of audience as this one does, but this is something that Heinlein made a habit of. Written almost fifty years ago, it reads just as well, if not better than anything published today.",1

When I learned that Dr. Bleau had released a 2nd edition of it, I bought it too. Yep, that's how much I like it. The main advantage I found of the 2nd edition over the 1st was that Bleau had updated her calculator coverage for the TI-84 (the TI-83 was used in the original), and that her explanations how to use the TI-84 were clear enough even for a neophyte like me to be able to follow. By the time I was halfway through the book, I'd become comfortable using the TI-84 with her text. Having said that, however, I'm still pretty old school. I still worked out all examples and problems long hand, and would just use the calculator as a quick reference.I'm still hoping that Bleau will consider releasing either a ""Forgotten Calculus"" Volume 2, or a ""Forgotten Calculus"" for engineering/math/science majors. C'mon, Dr. Bleau, whaddya say?Original review follows:When I picked up this book, I had completed one quarter of calculus at the university level (about 15 years prior), and had accumulated a bookshelf full of calculus texts and self-help books over the subsequent years, with the best of intentions of delving deeper into the subject. It never happened, though. All of the books I had obtained on the subject were either obtuse, mind-numbingly dull, or both. Then I discovered Dr. Bleau's Forgotten Calculus. At first, I was somewhat daunted by the title, because for me there was a lot of ""not-taken"" calculus in her book, but then I noted the blurb on the cover, the last clause of the last sentence, which read ""...and can be used by adults who have never studied calculus.""This is simply the best self-help book I have ever come across. It took me about two months to complete, working through the material in my spare time. The subject matter was stimulating and clearly explained, favoring the practical over the theoretical. Best of all, it left me wanting for more -- an uncommon feat for a math book, especially one about calculus.",1

All buried within a fine adventure story of just how the little group builds itself from an unrelated bunch of people huddling in a cave to a bustling, forward looking industrious town, with excellent characterizations of not just Rod but most of the people around him, and with very little direct preaching, but rather showing his points as results of the events and actions of his characters.Heinlein's typical unforced, simple American prose style is much in evidence here, making both dialog and descriptions seem perfectly natural. This makes for a very fast reading experience, with a lot of his philosophical points sliding in under the reader's conscious radar, only to wake you up at 3AM with an 'Oh, yeah! That makes sense.' And perhaps you will come away from this book, as I did, thinking that the idea of a school course in survival is something that should actually be implemented.Everyone, from teens to adults, homemakers to rugged individualists, engineers to social workers, can enjoy this book. There are very few works that can appeal to such a wide range of audience as this one does, but this is something that Heinlein made a habit of. Written almost fifty years ago, it reads just as well, if not better than anything published today.",1
A Summa of the Summa: The Essential Philosophical Passages of st Thomas Aquinas Summa Theologica Edited and Explained for Beginners,"A shortened version of Kreeft's much larger Summa of the Summa, which in turn was a shortened version of the Summa Theologica. The reason for the double shortening is pretty obvious: the original runs some 4000 pages! (The Summa of the Summa was just over 500.) The Summa is certainly the greatest, most ambitious, most rational book of theology ever written. In it, there is also much philosophy, which is selected, excerpted, arranged, introduced, and explained in footnotes here by Kreeft, a popular Thomist teacher and writer. St. Thomas Aquinas is universally recognized as one of the greatest philosophers who ever lived. His writings combine the two fundamental ideals of philosophical writing: clarity and profundity. He is a master of metaphysics and technical terminology, yet so full of both theoretical and practical wisdom. He is the master of common sense. The Summa Theologica is timeless, but particularly important today because of his synthesis of faith and reason, revelation and philosophy, and the Biblical and the classical Greco-Roman heritages. This little book is designed for beginners, either for classroom use or individually. It contains the most famous and influential passages of St. Thomas' philosophy with copious aids to understanding them.","['Saint Thomas (Aquinas)', 'Peter Kreeft']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gQ8AwQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=gQ8AwQEACAAJ&dq=A+Summa+of+the+Summa:+The+Essential+Philosophical+Passages+of+st+Thomas+Aquinas+Summa+Theologica+Edited+and+Explained+for+Beginners&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,1993,http://books.google.com/books?id=gQ8AwQEACAAJ&dq=A+Summa+of+the+Summa:+The+Essential+Philosophical+Passages+of+st+Thomas+Aquinas+Summa+Theologica+Edited+and+Explained+for+Beginners&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],1.0,0898703174,,A2D9IEFJGB483Q,Kendal B. Hunter,95/98,5.0,1005609600,Not a Doubting Thomas!,"You have to hand it to Kreeft for taking some of the greatest ratiocination ever, and translating it into commonspeak. Thomas Aquinas is one of the greatest minds ever to grace God's green earth, but too often--probably due to his religion--he has been marginalized. Generally, we just read his &quot;Five Ways&quot; that prove God's existence. However, this is much more to Thomism than this one philosophical derringer.For those unaware, Thomas Aquinas was the Catholic scholar who produces two L*A*R*G*E, multi-volume books on Catholic theology: ""Summa Contra Gentiles"" and ""Summa Theologica,"" the latter being a summation of Catholic theology. This book is a summation of ""Summa Theologica,"" and serves as a handbook and thumbnail for both Catholic Theology and Philosophy and Christian philosophy in general.Aquinas has a sharp mind and can both divide the word and divide a question in a way that few others can. I am not Catholic, but stand in deep admiration for Aquinas's work and mind, and more especially because he minded his work by working his mind.The Book:Kreeft has selected the essential texts and questions that illuminate aspects of Thomistic philosophy/theology. He has the text with explanatory notes in footnotes, which is unusual since we are not reading a summery or rephrasing of Aquinas, but actually reading his words and ideas, unfiltered and undistorted.His chapter divisions follow closely the divisions used in the whole ""Summa Theologica,"" and focus primarily on the first part of part one, and the second part of part two of the ""Summa Theologica,"" and doesn't deal with the latter books that deal with the church and the nature of sacraments. This summation, therefore, would not be offensive to any Christian.The notes are gems, especially with his illustrations--Kreeft has united his analytical left-brain with his creative right brain, so there is no double-mindedness with what he is doing. His pictures save a thousand words!The glossary is helpful for the Latin words and technical terms that have a specialized meaning in Thomism.The Printing:This book uses the ""Fathers of English Dominican Province"" translation, which bears the Nihil Obstant and Imprimatur, the Roman Catholic &quot;Good housekeeping Seal of Approval&quot; that lets us know the text has passed the censor. It is approved for Catholic consumption! As a non-Catholic, this because important because I do not want distorted doctrine misrepresenting their true beliefs.The type and font are perfect, and I have not seen any typos.

The bad point is that he knew almost nothing about his subject and as such has written an Englishman's compassionate contemporary account of the colonies.I live and work on a remote aboriginal community near the areas Chatwin visited. Traditional Aborignal law is an amazingly complex oral culture so rich in history and symbolism that I have profound doubts about any whitefella ever properly understanding it, let alone a visiting foreigner desperately looking for something.This is a great book, but don't think by reading it you will get a terrifically accurate profile of what being an aborigine is, whatever that means.

R. Bird ""Ramseelbird""",95/98,4.0,1139270400,The best heroic Norwegian historical fiction for kids in the English language,"So I'm at a fancy Manhattan party hosted by Columbia University. It's at a swank bar and I'm surrounded by Columbia graduate film students who are mooching like it's nobody's business. Bear with me, this actually has to do with the book, ""Snow Treasure"". I'm just a humble children's librarian who happens to be married to one of these students so I'm biding my time and drinking my free drink when I am introduced to yet another filmmaker. Usually when I tell such people what my job is they are inclined to nod politely and then scan the room frantically for someone more interesting. Not this gal. On hearing about my job she practically grabs me by my lapels (I say ""practically"" since I am not in the habit of wearing lapels) and asks excitedly, ""Have you read Snow Treasure?!?"". I try to pry her fingers from my clothing while admitting that as well-read as I like to boast that I am, I actually don't know this book. She then launches into an emphatic explanation of how much she enjoyed this story when she was a child and how she would like to film it herself someday. And since she goes to school with my husband, it seems only polite that I should read this supposedly marvelous little work. I do, enjoy the book thoroughly, and here we are today. Whether you like it or hate it, it's hard not to admit that ""Snow Treasure"" is one of those books that stays with you for years and years at a time.Peter is just your average Norwegian kid. He enjoys sledding in the snow, the occasional snowball fight, and hanging out with his friends and neighbors. Then the Nazis come. It's 1940 and Norway has been invaded by a particularly nasty enemy. This wouldn't be such a problem if Norway were a poor nation. Unfortunately they have gold bullion in their banks worth roughly $9,000,000. It would be great if the bank could get the unprocessed gold to a cargo ship waiting by the sea, but any form of transportation used would probably get searched by the invading army. But what if the carriers were the most innocent available? What if the children were put to use? Before Peter and his friends know it they're running a dangerous mission right under the noses of the Nazis. But will the Nazis ever figure out what exactly is going on? And, almost more importantly, will the snow last?Husband wants to know what I'm reading. I tell him it's that old classic piece of historical fiction, ""Snow Treasure"". Husband wants to know when it takes place. I tell him 1940. Husband asks when it was written. I tell him 1942, which shocks both of us equally. As World War II was going on, author Marie McSwigan must have heard this story/rumor, put on her writing glasses, and plugged out an exciting tale of children v. Nazis. Of course, recent printings of the book are mighty careful to include this little caveat in the front: ""For many years the story was believed true. But over 60 years later, there is no proof that it ever really happened"". So how did Ms. McSwigan hear of it? A quick perusal of the ever handy ""Something About the Author"" series (available in your local library) and we learn that McSwigan was a journalist back in the day. A Pittsburgh journalist at that. Perhaps (and this is entirely speculation at this point) she heard the rumor of the gold's rescue and made the obvious conclusion that true or not it would make a darned good book for children.It's odd reading the book secure in the knowledge that when it was published it was a toss up whether or not the Germans were going to win the war in the end. Certainly there isn't any mention of the Jews or their fate. There are, however, several references to concentration camps and the cruelty of the Nazis in general. The book is a teensy bit dated here and there, of course. Peter Lundstrom is twelve-years-old and is told by his father (leaving to fight in the war) to take care of the family since now he's the ""man"". Then again, McSwigan belies this at the end when Peter's uncle points out that his mother is perfectly capable of taking care of herself. Moreover, the girls in this book do everything the boys do and never show any weakness. Even in the face of a nasty Nazi kicking down their snowmen. It's not exactly Gloria Steinem territory, but it's still pretty good for the times. The writing is also upbeat and cuts to the chase right at the beginning. By page 14 you already know what the kids are going to do and it's fast-paced writing from there on in. It might not stand up to intense scrutiny today but it's definitely one of the more interesting books for children processed in 1942.In regards to the film student who wanted to make a movie out of ""Snow Treasure"" it'll break her heart, I'm sure, to learn that a film was already made of it in 1969. Sigh. In any case, with its slim size and its gripping plot this is one story that pops off of the page and has been in continual publication since the forties. A good book even today.",1

The maps don't cover all of Middle Earth -- instead they are regional maps that cover all the main action of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.The six maps are as follows, in more or less the order in which the characters in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; encounter them.1. The Shire. Includes all of the Shire, and goes beyond to include Lake Evendim in the north, the beginning of the Gulf of Lune in the west, and Bree on the far eastern edge. Hence it also includes the Old Forest and the Barrow Downs.2. Eregion. From Lothlorien in the southeast to Bree in the northwest; includes the Misty Mountains from just north of Fangorn up to the southern edge of the Ettenmoors. This one is at 30 miles to the inch; the others are all at 20 miles to the inch.3. Rohan. Includes Isengard at the western edge of the map; all of Fangorn forest, north as far the field of Celebrant at the southern edge of Mirkwood, and east to the east shore of the Anduin, including the Emyn Muil.4. West Gondor. The Lefnui river runs down the west edge of this map, which covers Pinnath Gelin, the Blackroot Vale, and Dol Amroth in the southeast.5. East Gondor. Belfalas in the southwest, with Dol Amroth just off the map; the mouths of the Anduin and east as far as south Ithilien and the foothills of the Mountains of Shadow. Minas Tirith is there, of course, and Osgiliath, but Minas Morgul is off the eastern edge of the map. Cair Andros is right at the north edge.6. Mordor. Mordor is a nice rectangular shape for a map, and the map covers it more or less exactly, with the addition of Ithilien as far as Osgiliath down the west edge.The maps are not colourful--click on the image of the box on the Amazon page and you'll see an enlarged view that shows the legend areas of all six maps; the colouring there is just as it is on the maps themselves, so that should give you an idea. However, despite the lack of strong colour, the calligraphy and cartography are beautiful.Reeve does not appear to have taken any liberties that I can see with the topography as described by Tolkien, either by inventing extra names to fill in blank spaces or changing anything. I was a bit surprised to see how large the Shire was, though; it's the same land area as Rohan, which simply astonished me -- I thought of it as a tiny place, perhaps sixty or so miles across, but Reese makes it over 250 miles from west to east, including Westmarch and Buckland. I went back to the original maps at the back of &quot;The Return of the King&quot;, and realized that Tolkien had in fact drawn it at least 150 miles across--the scale is so small it's hard to be precise--but it's still surprising.The booklet includes information about all the major regions of Middle Earth, whether or not they are on the map. On the back cover is a map of all of Middle Earth. Sadly, there's no overall poster to go with it--I'm still looking for a good one. The booklet is informative and moderately detailed; I would guess it's a handbook for a role-playing game, since a game is mentioned in the cover, but there are no more details.Overall, this is an attractive set of maps for a good price. The weak points are the lack of colour, and the fact that only parts of Middle Earth are mapped.",1

On wet days I will go into the thickest parts of the forests, where the pine needles are everlastingly dry, and when the sun shines I'll lie on the heath and see how the broom flares against the clouds. I shall be perpetually happy, because there will be no one to worry me.&quot; And so begins her solitary summer, filled with books, the garden(s), nature, her thoughts and reflections.

This effort by Ms. Ferrell and the book entitled No Lye both gave me the confidence a year ago to stop the chemicals. I started my search for information on how to get from under the chemical umbrella and discovered this book here on Amazon.com.I opted to use braids to grow out my chemical hair just because I knew I could not handle a teeney weeney afro, that's just not me. Well a year has gone by and I have a head full of natural hair and it's not scary at all. Trust me I had some bad moments the first time I had to take out my braids but have since come to see what Ms. Ferrell meant about the texture of your hair changing as it comes out from under the influence of the chemicals. My primary reason for going natural has nothing to do with Black pride, sorry to say. I had way more selfish reasons. I was worried about my health. Over the last few years I had undergone an intense learning period of understanding about the foods we eat or don't eat and the functions of the various organs of the body. When I realized the absorption capabilities of our skin I grew quite concerned. The skin is powerful and very good at one of it's jobs which is to absorb. I came to the conclusion that I should not have anything put on my scalp wherein my stylist had to wear gloves. If it was too dangerous for her hands it was too dangerous for me. Ms. Ferrell touches on this very topic and it was gratifying to see others express this concern.After having said all of this I have to admit I was still nervous the other day as I sat in the chair to get my first set of twist. Hallelujah.... I have been set free. It is so hard to describe the feeling of wearing my hair a la natural. I do believe this is easy enough with straight twisting to do it on my own soon enough but..... I am lazy and just like other people's hands in my head.So whatever your reasons for wanting to go natural this book is great. I have to agree with another reviewer and put in a request for more styles in the next book but this is excellent for those just starting out.",1

It is NOT a book by Kolmogorov/Fomin, but rather an edited version by Silverman. So, if you read the first lines in the Editor's Preface, it states, ""The present course is a freely revised and restyled version of ... the Russian original"". Further down it continues, ""...As in the other volumes of this series, I have not hesitated to make a number of pedagogical and mathematical improvements that occurred to me..."". Read it as a big red warning flag. Alas, I would have to agree with the reader from Rio de Janeiro. I've been working through this book to rehash my knowledge of measure theory and Lebesgue integration as a prerequisite for stochastic calculus. And I've encountered many results of ""mathematical improvements"" that occurred to the esteemed ""translator"". Things are fine when topics/theorems are not too sophisticated (I guess not much room for ""improvements""). Not so when you work through some more subtle proofs. Most mistakes I discovered are relatively easy to rectify (and I'm ignoring typos). But the latest is rather egregious. The proof of theorem 1 from ch. 9 (p.344-345) (about the Hahn decomposition induced on X by a signed measure F) contains such a blatant error, I am very hard pressed to believe it comes from the original. That book survived generations of math students at Moscow State, and believe me, they would go through each letter of the proofs. Astounded by such an obvious nonsense, I grabed the only other reference book on the subject I had at hand, ""Measure Theory"" by Halmos. The equivalent there is theorem A, sec. 29 (p.121 of Springer-Verlag edition), which has a correct proof.For those interested in details, Silverman's proof states that positive integers are strictly ordered: k1&lt;k2&lt;...&lt;kn&lt;... which is nonsense. Consider subsets B1 and B2 such that F(B1)=3, F(B2)=2, for example. That gives you both k1=k2=1. The flaw of course is not in this slip-up per se, but rather in the logic of the proof which follows from the above ordering of k's. Compare vs Halmos text to see the difference. It may seem insignificant to certain translators, but in mathematics, out of all of sciences, subtle details change an elegant proof to a flagrant nonsense.Unfortunately, I don't have the Russian original. Instead, I'm trying to get the other, hopefully real translation, ""Elements of the Theory of Functions and Functional Analysis"". BTW, this is the actual title of the original, not ""Introductory Real Analysis"". Which apparently is causing significant confussion amoung past and present readers. To give you a background info, the Russian original is (or has been, at least) used as a textbook for a third-year subject for (hard-core) math students. Meaning, in the preceding two years they would complete a pre-requisite four-semester calculus course. For example, criteria of convergence of series and their properties is an assumed knowledge in presentation of Lebesgue integral. So, I think most of the critique from earlier reivews is a bit misdirected. The original book is a great starting book into functional analyis/Lebesgue integration and differentiation, but proofs require solid understanding of fundamentals of calculus.The best part about Kolmogorov's text is the clarity of conceptual structure of the presented subject a reader would gain, if he/she puts some effort. You would gain a thorough understanding, not just a knowledge of the subject. There is quite a difference between the two, and not that many authors succeed in delivering that.But to gain that from Kolmogorov, I would suggest the other, ""unimproved"" but real, translation.",1

It's one of my favorite books on trading. Out of this classic came such new indicators as the Force Index, which is one of the indicators I use regularly in my chart software. I read Elder's follow-up, Come Into My Trading Room, in hopes of learning additional insights of the Force Index. While I found some new information here, I was even more impressed by the following lessons Elder shared:1) &quot;Some of the best trading opportunities occur after false breakouts&quot; - I'm finding this more and more these days, which is why I actively use my Momentum Divergence indicators to separate the fakeouts from the real breakouts. Elder does a great job showing numerous charts throughout his book, laying the groundwork for the divergence examples he explains in great depth when you step into his trading room in the final chapter with many actual trading examples. You need to understand the concept of divergence to trade today's markets more profitably, and this book will be a great help in showing you how to trade divergence setups.2) Triple Screen - Elder explains the important of using multiple timeframes, though he advocates two to no more than three time frames. The key concept is that whatever timeframe you use, you need to go up to the next longer timeframe to get confirmation. This provides the bigger picture trend to define the nature of your trades, and then you can return to the shorter timeframe and make more tactical decisions with this broader trend in mind as well.3) Grade Your Performance - Elder actually quantifies trading effectiveness by defining the width of the channel for a stock, and what percentage of the move the trader actually captured to determine his grade. Regardless of how a trader measures his performance, it must be tracked in order to make improvements and experience constant improvement.4) The SafeZone Stop - While I have not tested this indicator in my systems yet, Elder's SafeZone Stop looks like a more effective way to place a trailing stop than standard moving averages. The SafeZone Stop appears to adjust more rapidly to trending versus flat periods for a stock, compared to moving averages. This new technique should easily be worth many times the price of this book by itself.5) Chapter 9: Trading for a Living - This chapter was my most highlighted chapter, as Elder covers the stages of growth from beginning to professional trader, covering a wide range of topics on trading discipline, time management, organization and developing a viable trading plan, to highlight just a few.All in all, Come Into My Trading Room is an excellent follow-up to Elder's Trading For A Living, and I think you'll also find it a quick and thought-provoking read.",1

Often mistaken for other maladies, the yeast syndrome can lead to headaches, sore muscles, general fatigue, low resistance to colds and viruses, and other problems in both men and women. Of the two most common prescription treatments, one can inflict severe liver damage and the other is safe but of only limited effectiveness. Fortunately, there are potent natural alternatives. They’re clearly explained here by Dr. Michael T. Murray, co-author of the bestselling Encyclopedia of Natural Medicine. You will learn how to: • Determine if you suffer from candida yeast syndrome • Follow Dr. Murray’s seven step program for combating candidiasis • Adjust you daily diet to control candida growth • Supplement your meals with nourishing vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants • Strengthen your immune system to help resist candidiasis and many other invasive disorders • And much more!

Gaskell's eloquent prose engrosses the reader into the lives of the multiple characters and as it is in three volumes, much time is spent developing each individual. This allows for a true feeling and understanding of the motives and meanings behind every action. The character of Ruth is obviously the most important and Gaskell allows her to develop into an almost Christ-like figure in her beliefs, faith and actions.

The author, a former overseas NPR correspondent, describes her sojourn over the years 2001-2005 in Kandahar, the ancient capital of Afghanistan, where she worked for an Afghan-based NGO and, as an instinctive investigative reporter, formed her own assessment of the political forces at work in that post-Taliban city.Her conclusions are both alarming and disheartening. She comes to believe that Pakistan is the root cause of political instability in Afghanistan and that through its support of warlords it uses resurgent Taliban forces to manipulate and regain control of large parts of the country. More discouraging is the author's portrayal of President Hamid Karzai as an intelligent, gifted, and cultured man who is often ineffectual as a leader.The book is framed by the account of an assassination of the Kabul chief of police, a man of unusual integritiy and ability (hence the book's title) and its subsequent coverup as a suicide bombing. Set against him is the power-hungry and corrupt governor of Kandahar, who has won the confidence of the Americans while secretly amassing a fortune that he uses to fund a private army, meanwhile working deals with Pakistan to keep alive the threat of Taliban terrorism that makes the Americans even more dependent on him.There are large swathes of Afghan and Persian history woven into this modern-day accounting, which reveal patterns of political and cultural forces at play that go back to Alexander the Great. Vividly written, the book provides a disturbing portrayal of failed leadership on the part of both the U.S. and the current government in Kabul. Read it and weep.",0
Suicide and Attempted Suicide: Methods and Consequences,"A brave, compassionate, and ethical study examines the methods, unforeseen results, and other alternatives to suicide and discusses such topics as the psychological makeup of suicidal people, ways to prevent suicide, the comfort care and hospice care available for those who disable themselves, and more.",['Geo Stone'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cBOLQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=cBOLQgAACAAJ&dq=Suicide+and+Attempted+Suicide:+Methods+and+Consequences&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Carroll & Graf Pub,1999,http://books.google.com/books?id=cBOLQgAACAAJ&dq=Suicide+and+Attempted+Suicide:+Methods+and+Consequences&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Psychology'],1.0,0786704926,,,,95/97,4.0,953856000,"Not the best book on suicide, but the best on suicide method","(...)this is a book about which it's hard to be neutral. If you think that suicide is always wrong, a sin, or a crime, you won't like it: the book provides lots of &quot;how-to&quot; information that can be used to commit suicide. But at the same time there is an anti-suicide thread running through the text---time and again, the author suggests delay, alternatives, and medical treatment, so the in-your-face pro-suicide crowd (small, but vocal) won't be happy either. Further, the author's website contains, among other things, lots of grisly photos that seem intended to discourage suicide.Unlike Gaul, the book is divided into two parts. The first half is an overview of suicide, covering history, causes of suicide (considered through sociology, psychiatry, and biology), American and Dutch end-of-life medical practices, and a few related areas. Compressed into a little over a hundred pages, this broad coverage is not terribly detailed but functions well as a summary and is both interesting and well done.The second half describes, with sometimes weirdly-fascinating factoids, what is known about suicide methods (the &quot;how-to&quot; part) and their medical consequences (the &quot;why-you-probably-shouldn't-try-them&quot; part). If you're interested in suicide methods, this is the best source of information available. If you're not, there's far more information here than you want to know. Trust me.The book's layout is poor. References are in the back organized by chapter, but pages in the text don't have chapter headers, so it's easy to lose your place, whilst flipping back and forth. Footnotes are at the end of each chapter instead of at the bottom of the page, another annoying practise, and there are a surprising number of typso. &lt;g&gt;In sum, if you want to know why people kill themselves, there are better sources.

But don't be fooled into thinking this is going to be the stilted, polite prose that often belongs to 18th century philosophers or debaters. Many of the pieces Bailyn has selected are remakrkably spry and teeming with understated wit.Those who think that mud-slinging, negative campaigning, and assaults on the integrity of the opponent are modern day creations may be surprised to see that those in the 18th century could be just as nitpicky, petty, and ascerbic as their present day decendants -- and yet still remain surprisingly gentlemanly about the whole thing. Some letter writers absolutely seethe with irritation at their opposition, and by presenting his debaters in roughly chronological order, Bailyn ensures that for every &quot;Oh yeah?&quot; uttered by a Federalist, there will soon be a responsive &quot;Yeah!&quot; from the anti-Federalist side. It all makes for lively and informative reading, and one wonders if such a critical debate could be carried out with such manners in today's media.It should come as no surprise that most of the Hamilton-Madison-Jay Federalist Papers are in here, as are the level-headed, persuasive anti-Federalist arguments of James Wilson and George Mason. But the real jewels in these volumes lie in the thoughtful and frank correspondence that passed back and forth between not only the Major Players, but also between some of the lesser-known writers, who make their cases for or against the Constitution with genuine passion and conviction.Bailyn wisely leaves the spin to the writers themselves, but when he does step in, Bailyn is a most helpful editor, and the final 240 pages contain short biographies of every writer (or letter recipient) in the book, an informative chronology of events (and Bailyn makes sure readers have a perspective for the debates in this book by starting the chronology in 1774, some 13 years before the first words in this book were spoken), and competent notes on the text to help readers unfamiliar with some of the players or events keep everything sorted out.Even though we all have the luxury of knowing that Everything Came Out All Right In The End -- the Constitution was ratified -- there is still quite a bit of drama here, particularly in the debates in the State Ratifying Conventions, which are carried out with suitable handwringing and bluster on both sides. Appropriately, then, the final piece in here is the dramatic speech the previously skeptical John Hancock delivered in the Massachusetts convention, informing his colleagues he would, indeed, vote for ratification. Hancock's words are as stirring now as they were then -- but I'll let you read them for yourself.If you have the opportunity, purchase both Volume I and Volume II together. Not only will you get the complete debates (Volume I ends in February 1788; volume II is needed to make it to August), but you'll also get one of the Library of America's typically attractive slip-cases. It's a little more expensive, but worth it.",1
Faeries,"Identifies and pictures all the faery types including elves, gnomes, pixies, leprechauns, and dryads, drawing from Celtic stories, the great English-language oral tradition, and the works of poets to illuminate their haunts, pastimes, and ways of life",['David Larkin'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1pNKP7ryD0wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=1pNKP7ryD0wC&q=Faeries&dq=Faeries&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,New York : Abrams,1978,http://books.google.com/books?id=1pNKP7ryD0wC&dq=Faeries&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],17.0,B000K5PRL2,,A1ARHZTPIWG49I,S.

It's a compilation of gorgeous watercolors, sketches, and a systematic like grouping of faeries and their mythical kin. I can't imagine a better book for a young artist or creative reader. I spent hours and hours poring over each illustration and reading about the origins of all the creatures. It has a Jim Henson-like quality in its imaginative spirit (echoed by one of the jacket covers which features Froud with a little puppet faery mannikin posed in a tree). Alan Lee is responsible for those gorgeous watercolors, while Brian Froud does the kinetic sketches (Froud was also the illustrator of Lady Cottingtons Book of Pressed Faeries--a funny and darkly humored picture book). Sidenote: Brian Froud's wife, Wendy, was one of the artists responsible for the very beautiful (if slightly dated) Dark Crystal and, I did not know this--YODA!! Who knew?! Wonderful news, too, the 25th edition of this book contains 20 new pieces by Froud and Lee.As for the nakedness: When I was six I thought everyone's body was beautiful and nakedness definitely didn't put me off. The only times it was disturbing was when adults made a big deal of it. That and finding a discarded copy of Penthouse behind an abandoned building both fascinated and freaked me out. But Froud's book is nothing like that. I'd no more be upset by the nudity in this then I would by the nudity in Renaissance paintings. I'm guessing adults must read more eroticism into it than any child would. If you're really worried, check out Brian Froud's website--it has some of the illustrations from Faeries and will give you a better sense of it. Personally, I think it's a wonderful book for children. Not to harp on, but I don't think un-erotic and un-sensationalized exposure to nudity is a bad thing (and I don't mean that in a let's all be nudists manner...just a hey, we all got skin underneath our clothes recognition).If there's someone in your life who has a fly-away imagination and appreciation for art or myth, this is a terrific choice.",1
Mounce's Complete Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words,"For years, Vine’s Expository Dictionary has been the standard word study tool for pastors and laypeople, selling millions of copies.

A simple lay person has to believe that it is up-to-date.2. I do find OT entries more complete than the Vine's, but shorter in definition. It simply has more entries for OT words than Vine's book. And I find it useful.3. Dictionaries at the back really helps. These dictionaries are not concordance dictionaries where you find them at the back of concordance. These dictionaries provide short but clear definitions for the word at hand. Truly handy.4. Hardcover book is clean and tight. Pages are thin (like the pages of the Bible)... this could be either pro or con depends on your preference.CONS:1. Some NT entries are not necessarily better than Vine's in my opinion. Such terms as ""envy"" ""godly, godliness"" and OT entry ""wisdom"" are better explained in Vine's. Hence, some entries are better than Vine's but other entries, the Vine is clearly better.2. Personally, I do not like the format of the book (but this is subjective judgment). Under the English entry, both Hebrew and Greek corresponding words are discussed. To me this is a bit inconvenient. I like the Vine's format better: having separate entries for Hebrew words and Greek words.Overall, I do like the book and recommend it. But I suggest that you use the book with good old Vine's Expository Dictionary. For my studies, Vine is hard beat.",1

Many people dislike it or don't like it as much when compared to Pride and Prejudice or Emma, but there are many reasons why Persuasion should not be compared to Austen's other novels. This novel was the last one that Austen wrote before she died. It is a more mature novel, dealing with many issues not found in Austen's previous novels. One reason why people find faults with the book is that Anne Elliot, the heroine, is not as spunky or witty as an Elizabeth Bennett or an Emma Woodhouse. There is not so much wit flowing in the dialogue between characters, or even dialogue in general. But these differences between the novels make this one so unique.It is a novel of second chances. Anne Elliot, no longer in the bloom of youth, is a grown woman of 27 or 28 years. Eight years ago she had been happily in love with a handsome man named Frederick Wentworth. But, unfortunately, due to his financial status, and Anne under the influence of her family and close friend, was forced to reject his marriage proposal and they parted ways. But now, he is within her closest circle once again. Circumstances led to Anne staying with her married sister, Mrs. Muskgrove, while her own house was being let to Wentworth's sister and husband. Wentworth visits his sister and on calling on the Muskgroves finds Anne among them. Anne finds Wentworth, not only looking as good as he ever did, but is now Captain Wentworth, who has made his fortune. Wentworth, still angry with Anne over being rejected, causes him to treat Anne very cooly. But over many weeks of contact here and there, you catch on that Captain Wentworth isn't all that oblivious to Anne anymore, because of all the little 'glimpses' he throws at Anne. The tension between the two is amazing. You can sense a connection between the two, even though they are on opposite ends of the room. In Bath, the tension builds and builds until it culminates into one of the most moving and romantic reunions ever. The letter that Wentworth writes to Anne declaring his love is bound to bring a tear to your eye and a pang in your heart. Happily, all ends well, but throughout the novel you can easily sympathize with Anne. No longer youthful and no longer as pretty as she used to be, she is full of self-consciousness and confusion. She still loves him after all those years, but she cannot act upon her desires.Austen, yet again, excels in portraying her characters. Anne and Captain Wentworth are full and delightful characters that one must love. Her descriptions of Anne's vain father and snobbish older sister, Elizabeth, hit the mark on satirizing the members of society during that time. She wittingly describes how everyone tolerates Mrs. Muskgrove's hypochondriatic self and how everyone deals with her in their own way. There is not so much dialogue between characters in this book, compared to Austen's other novels. Most of the book is in observation of Anne's character and feelings, which makes it so much easier to relate to everything that Anne feels and you understand her situation all the more. This is a wonderful novel, with many qualities, differing from those of Austen's previous novels, to enjoy and admire.",1

Anne Elliot, no longer in the bloom of youth, is a grown woman of 27 or 28 years. Eight years ago she had been happily in love with a handsome man named Frederick Wentworth. But, unfortunately, due to his financial status, and Anne under the influence of her family and close friend, was forced to reject his marriage proposal and they parted ways. But now, he is within her closest circle once again. Circumstances led to Anne staying with her married sister, Mrs. Muskgrove, while her own house was being let to Wentworth's sister and husband. Wentworth visits his sister and on calling on the Muskgroves finds Anne among them. Anne finds Wentworth, not only looking as good as he ever did, but is now Captain Wentworth, who has made his fortune. Wentworth, still angry with Anne over being rejected, causes him to treat Anne very cooly. But over many weeks of contact here and there, you catch on that Captain Wentworth isn't all that oblivious to Anne anymore, because of all the little 'glimpses' he throws at Anne. The tension between the two is amazing. You can sense a connection between the two, even though they are on opposite ends of the room. In Bath, the tension builds and builds until it culminates into one of the most moving and romantic reunions ever. The letter that Wentworth writes to Anne declaring his love is bound to bring a tear to your eye and a pang in your heart. Happily, all ends well, but throughout the novel you can easily sympathize with Anne. No longer youthful and no longer as pretty as she used to be, she is full of self-consciousness and confusion. She still loves him after all those years, but she cannot act upon her desires.Austen, yet again, excels in portraying her characters. Anne and Captain Wentworth are full and delightful characters that one must love. Her descriptions of Anne's vain father and snobbish older sister, Elizabeth, hit the mark on satirizing the members of society during that time. She wittingly describes how everyone tolerates Mrs. Muskgrove's hypochondriatic self and how everyone deals with her in their own way. There is not so much dialogue between characters in this book, compared to Austen's other novels. Most of the book is in observation of Anne's character and feelings, which makes it so much easier to relate to everything that Anne feels and you understand her situation all the more. This is a wonderful novel, with many qualities, differing from those of Austen's previous novels, to enjoy and admire.",1

It started after taking large amounts of antibiotics to heal from pneumonia.Feeling very bad as most IBS sufferers, I tried several diets, went to a lot of GI doctors and even tried acupuncture, reflexology, ... you name it.I took antidepressants for a while to help me with my mood since I felt so bad in times that I didn't even want to work or even get out of home. I lost 40 pounds so far.Since January 2005, I read these books (I put a personal rating to each one, related to how much it helped me with my IBS, in parenthesis from 1 to 5, being 5 the best score):Breaking the Vicious Cycle - Elaine Gotschall (3)Eating Right for a bad Gut - James Scala (2)Total health Program - Joseph Mercola (3)Metabolic Type Dieting - William Linz Wolcott, Trish Fahey (1)I recently read ""Restoring Your Digestive Health"" (5)To the point:Besides the fact that many, if not everyone, of the people who write this kind of books look for some sort of monetary earnings (and many do that just for the money), there always stays the fact about whether the material presented has a real value or not. In other words, do the programs and recommendations in this book really work?For me they did. In fact it is my personal opinion that this book encloses many of the concepts that I've been studying for the past year. It gives you a brief explanation about many of them. In that respect at least, I wished I had bought this book before the other ones, since in the end it is like a little reference of them. Bad luck.Of course I don't agree with many things, for instance the ""structured water"" suplement, since based on other sources I read, it is very controversial an in many aspects without scientific background, although the authors may recommend it based on their clinical experience rather than anything else. More probably I think, they are trying to encourage people to buy their supplements (who can blame them).So back to the main point here, maybe the authors are willing that the readers go out and buy some of their supplements, but the issue here is whether the Guts and Glory program works. It will be fair to mention that the authors never tell you not to have any conventional drugs nor they force you to have any supplements. They even give you a ""Low Budget"" alternative where you'll never even buy a supplement, although they argue it will take you longer to heal. I think the authors are more objective than the more radical approaches of the other books I read.And of course, MOST importantly, I've been in the Guts and Glory program for 4 weeks and I feel BETTER than years!!!!. I know it's only my word, but I'm being honest here. I'm talking the Brasco Broth everyday, and I'm not even talking any extra supplement beside Chlorella, which I've been taking for 5 months now.If it's worth something, this is the only review I've written so far about any book that I read. This is because I'm encouraging you to at least give it a try. If you are an IBS slave like I've been the last years, it could help you a lot.So I don't care if the idea was to make me buy more supplements, in the end I'm not buying them anyway, but I DO feel better. I make my own goat yogurt (very cheap) and my own Sauerkraut (even cheaper). Maybe the only supplements I take, besides Chlorella, are the digestive enzymes, but I've been taking them for over a year now.Conclusion: Even if a partial intention of the book is to make you buy more supplements (which I think it is so) in the end I think that the program works simply because it is the only thing in years which has made me feel better.If anyone wishes to contact me (for legitimate reasons) you can freely do it at gaspar2428@yahoo.es",1

They are well worth viewing and then reading (and then buy the book).I do hope that Mr. Black lives to write a new book about the current scam, as Bill Moyers quotes from Black's earlier investigations, ""...so enraged was one of those bankers, Charles Keating -- after whom the senate's so-called 'Keating Five' were named -- he sent a memo that read, in part, 'get Black -- kill him dead.' Metaphorically, of course. Of course."" I wish Mr. Black well and safe, after this interview...From the transcript:BILL MOYERS: ""...his main targets are the Wall Street barons, heirs of an earlier generation whose scandalous rip-offs of wealth back in the 1930s earned them comparison to Al Capone and the mob, and the nickname ""banksters.""andWILLIAM K. BLACK: ""Well, the way that you do it [large corporate failures and scandals] is to make really bad loans, because they pay better. Then you grow extremely rapidly, in other words, you're a Ponzi-like scheme. And the third thing you do is we call it leverage. That just means borrowing a lot of money, and the combination creates a situation where you have guaranteed record profits in the early years. That makes you rich, through the bonuses that modern executive compensation has produced. It also makes it inevitable that there's going to be a disaster down the road.""",1

The Life And Religion of Mohammed : The Prophet of Arabia,Mohammed's life by a priest in India who worked from the earliest Islamic sources.,['J. L.

Menezes describes how this simple, illiterate man became the prophet and proponent of a religion currently adhered to by about 20% of the world's population. Of particular interest is how Mohammed's apparent admiration for the faith of the Jews and Christians in Arabia turned to hatred and vengeance; how this once-monogamous man, upon the death of his beloved first wife, proceeded to accumulate an enormous harem which included both a young girl and the wife of his adopted son; and how his ""revelations"" from God were used to justify (especially for himself, as God's chosen prophet) such licentiousness, along with brutal killings and the spread of Islam by the sword.The author also describes how Islam was influenced by the pagan religion in Arabia at the time Mohammed lived, but also Judaism and Christianity. It is interesting to note how highly Mohammed spoke of the Jewish and Christian scriptures and yet how, nowadays, Christians and Jews are so often despised by Moslems and distribution of their scriptures are forbidden in many Moslem countries. After several references to Koranic texts on the importance and veracity of the Jewish and Christian scriptures, Menezes writes, ""These are admirable and indisputable testimonies by which a fair minded man and even a candid Mahommedan can see that the genuineness and authenticity of the Old and New Testaments have been completely attested by the Koran. Furthermore it solemnly adds that his people who have received the Scriptures (Koran) have no solid grounds of faith, their foundation is insecure and insufficient and their religion is futile, unless they observe and follow the Tourat [Pentateuch] and the Gospel.""The sections on Islamic beliefs, the Koran itself and the different sects within Islam are also enlightening. I now understand more clearly the tensions between the Shiite and Sunni Moslems in Iraq.I would definitely recommend this book for a clearer understanding of the Islamic faith. I gave it four stars instead of five because the text is replete with annoying mispellings and typographical errors. The punctuation could also be updated to make it easier to read. It seems to me that when you pay $20-$25 for a book, you should be getting one that has at least been well-edited.",1

"Jane Austen's Guide to Good Manners: Compliments, Charades & Horrible Blunders","How to pay and return formal 'calls'; how to refuse a proposal of marriage; who should lead off the dancing at a country-house ball; what to wear for a morning walk... Today such social niceties are largely ignored or forgotten, but they underpin all of Jane Austen's timeless novels and are explored and dealt with in this highly original book. Written as if intended for Austen's original readers in the Regency era, and illustrated with exquisitely witty watercolours, Jane Austen's Guide to Good Manners is a light-hearted, entertaining and instructive little handbook of etiquette as depicted in Jane's novels and letters. It will not only offer sound wisdom and pearls of advice, but also encourage the modern-day reader to look back at Jane's work with a new and deepened appreciation.","['Josephine Ross', 'Henrietta Webb']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0aBaqvCXtCQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=0aBaqvCXtCQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Jane+Austen%27s+Guide+to+Good+Manners:+Compliments,+Charades&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",A&C Black,2012-06-01,"http://books.google.com/books?id=0aBaqvCXtCQC&dq=Jane+Austen%27s+Guide+to+Good+Manners:+Compliments,+Charades&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Humor'],2.0,159691274X,10.17,ABXBWSPM6YHAI,"Rebecca Huston ""telynor""",95/96,5.0,1167091200,"Helping to explain some of the more obscure aspects of Jane Austen's works, with elegance and art","Being a fan of nearly everything Jane Austen, it was pretty much a foregone conclusion that I would buy this book. The Regency period of English history -- from about 1790 to 1820 -- has always interested me, and has been a lucrative trade for modern romance writers, but I was curious about something. How was the Regency period actually? And to solve that question, writer Josephine Ross goes right to the source: none other than the most famous author of the Regency period, Jane Austen, who wrote six novels, and a wide selection of letters, to find out what were the correct manners of the time.The Regency period was a time when to know how to behave was important. Having the knowledge of when to speak, how to speak, dress, and even introduce yourself could make or break your social success. With a gentle tongue-in-cheek humor, Josephine Ross takes examples from Austen's heroes and heroines to show the right way to behave, in a series of chapters that run the gamut from conversation to marriage and children.Beginning with an Introduction about the Authoress, Jane Austen herself, the reader is guided into the world of polite society, starting with Manners, Introductions, Conversation, Dining and Dancing, Dress and Taste, Matrimony, Family and finally, Servants. For each aspect, Ross draws on the observations made in the books and letters, and more importantly, shows why a blunder -- or save -- was made.What I really liked about the book is that it suddenly opened up some of the more obtuse passages in the books that didn't make much sense to me when I had first read them. Of course, Jane Austen already knew that her audience were very familiar with the background that she was working with, and so naturally, didn't bother to explain anything. But for the modern reader, with our quick world of the internet, flashy clothing, and a rather casual attitude towards relationships, some of the behavior seems downright strange. Why would plain white clothing make a woman fashionable above all else; why would a gentlewoman never, but never, visit a man alone, and how being able to make an introduction could prove to be invaluable later?And yes, many of these same ideas apply in our own world. Some might find them to be terribly old fashioned, but some basics still matter -- especially when a person finds themselves in a scenario where good manners do count, such as say, in a business setting or when meeting potential in-laws, and both skill and tact are called for.Along with the humor and various aha! moments, the other pleasure of this book were the delicate watercolours painted by Henrietta Webb that illustrated the book throughout. They caught the mood perfectly, and with just a dash of irony as well.For collectors and fans of Jane Austen's novels, and anyone who needs a good laugh or quiet chuckle, this slim volume -- it's under 150 pages in length -- would make a delightful little present. The layout and design is lovely, and easy on the eyes, presented in a small, hardback format. Josephine Ross has also written a more scholarly work on Jane Austen, which goes into more detail about life in the Regency period.Happily recommended.",1

So far as I can tell, the only difference from the earlier edition is the (very nice) dustjacket.The book includes a history of the sword, some basic information, though it's not a primer on collecting, and some good photographs of some truly excellent blades and fittings. The largest criticism I would make is that the photographs of blades don't show the subtle details, especially of the temper and &quot;grain&quot;, which collectors are interested in. On the other hand, you can see the whole shape of the blade well in the photographs.If you're interested in swords, this book is a must-have. Serious collectors will find it a bit simplistic and general of course, but the blades included are some of the best, which makes up for a lot. For people who just are interested by Japanese swords and want to find something out about them, this book is perfect. For the beginning collector this is good, but something like Yumoto's &quot;Japanese Sword: A Handbook&quot; is more important.",1

This novel was the last one that Austen wrote before she died. It is a more mature novel, dealing with many issues not found in Austen's previous novels. One reason why people find faults with the book is that Anne Elliot, the heroine, is not as spunky or witty as an Elizabeth Bennett or an Emma Woodhouse. There is not so much wit flowing in the dialogue between characters, or even dialogue in general. But these differences between the novels make this one so unique.It is a novel of second chances. Anne Elliot, no longer in the bloom of youth, is a grown woman of 27 or 28 years. Eight years ago she had been happily in love with a handsome man named Frederick Wentworth. But, unfortunately, due to his financial status, and Anne under the influence of her family and close friend, was forced to reject his marriage proposal and they parted ways. But now, he is within her closest circle once again. Circumstances led to Anne staying with her married sister, Mrs. Muskgrove, while her own house was being let to Wentworth's sister and husband. Wentworth visits his sister and on calling on the Muskgroves finds Anne among them. Anne finds Wentworth, not only looking as good as he ever did, but is now Captain Wentworth, who has made his fortune. Wentworth, still angry with Anne over being rejected, causes him to treat Anne very cooly. But over many weeks of contact here and there, you catch on that Captain Wentworth isn't all that oblivious to Anne anymore, because of all the little 'glimpses' he throws at Anne. The tension between the two is amazing. You can sense a connection between the two, even though they are on opposite ends of the room. In Bath, the tension builds and builds until it culminates into one of the most moving and romantic reunions ever. The letter that Wentworth writes to Anne declaring his love is bound to bring a tear to your eye and a pang in your heart. Happily, all ends well, but throughout the novel you can easily sympathize with Anne. No longer youthful and no longer as pretty as she used to be, she is full of self-consciousness and confusion.

Persuasion (Penguin Audio Classics),"Jane Austen’s last completed novel, a brilliantly insightful story of regret, second chances, and the courage to follow our hearts Anne Elliot is twenty-seven and unmarried—by all accounts a spinster in her time—seemingly doomed to spend the rest of her life waiting on her image-obsessed father and extravagant older sister; attempting to maintain their once lavish, now dwindling family estate; and occasionally babysitting the children of her married younger sister. It wasn’t always this way, though. When Anne was nineteen, she was in love with and engaged to Frederick Wentworth, a man with no money and few prospects. Anne’s well-meaning family and friends convinced her that a young heiress like herself could do better, so she broke off the engagement. But when chance brings Wentworth and Anne together again eight years later, he is now an accomplished naval captain with an impressive fortune, and Anne must face her feelings for him that remain and consider how different her life could have been if only she hadn’t been so easily persuaded by others.",['Jane Austen'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ynsrdImzs5QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=ynsrdImzs5QC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Persuasion+(Penguin+Audio+Classics)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin,2011-06-28,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ynsrdImzs5QC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],2.0,0141804564,,AWAM5AA3292Q2,"""lanfear30""",95/96,5.0,1020124800,Beautifully written,"This book is one of my favorites of all time.

For those of us who love Tintin, but aren't really up there with the fanatic Tintin worshipers, it's a bit too much.To start with, note that ""Tintin - The Complete Companion"" is the English version of a book that, as far as I can determine, was published simultaneously in both English and French (""Tintin, le rve et la r&eacute;alit&eacute;: L'histoire de la cr&eacute;ation des aventures de Tintin""). Michael Farr is bilingual and I'm guessing (although I don't know for sure) that the two versions are somewhat different. The English version, which I'm reviewing, is primarily focused on discussing the English editions of the Tintin books.Following a 2-page Introduction the remainder of this book consists of 21 very detailed chapters, each of which discusses a single Tintin adventure. As three of the Tintin adventures are published as a pair of books this implies that all 24 of the Tintin books, from ""Tintin in the Land of the Soviets"" to ""Tintin and Alph-Art"" (the final unfinished adventure), are covered.The amount of detail is incredible. Each chapter averages 10 pages, and although there are a lot of pictures and photographs from the Tintin books and other sources, there is also a lot of text.The following material is present, and often very detailed:- A synopsis of each story.- Information about the historical background for each story, for example the Japan-China war, the build-up to WW II, WW II itself (a period of Tintin escapist stories), the Cold War, etc.- Detailed discussions (sometimes excessively long-winded) about the characters and explanations of how many of them become members of ""the Tintin family"", reappearing regularly or occasionally in later adventures.- Discussions of where Herg&eacute; found inspiration for stories, characters, locations, machines and other items that made their way into the drawings. There are often pictures from Herg&eacute;'s files shown side-by-side with the resulting drawings. (The cover of this book is a masterful merging of a drawing from a Tintin book and the photograph that Herg&eacute; used as inspiration for the drawing.)- Some of the Tintin adventures were revised and produced in new versions. For example, most of the stories that were originally in black and white were re-released in color, and sometimes revised once more later. The various versions of each story are compared to see what was changed.- Although the English version of this book is primarily focused on the English versions of the Tintin books, there are many discussions of what was changed from the original French versions to the English translated versions.- An analysis of Herg&eacute;'s development as an artist and storyteller, from fairly primitive drawings and political naivety to sure artistic style and worldly understanding and finally political cynicism.- Information about how Herg&eacute;'s life was influenced by his work with Tintin. For example, Herg&eacute; was charged with being a collaborator after WW II because he had continued to produce Tintin during the war, and he had medical problems from the stress that accompanied his success.- Similarly, there is information about how the Tintin stories were influenced by and reflected Herg&eacute;'s private life: the down-beat ""Tintin in Tibet"" created while Herg&eacute; was depressed and getting divorced, and the hilarious ""The Castafiore Emerald"" created after his divorce and reflecting his happiness with a new love.- Herg&eacute;'s habit of putting himself and his friends into the stories.- Occasional mistakes made by Herg&eacute; are uncovered.The book ends with a comprehensive index.If you set out to read this book then you should have a complete collection of the Tintin books in English at hand. And be warned: You will end up spending many, many days before you finally put this book aside. That's because you'll pick up a Tintin adventure to check up on something Michael Farr says about it, and end up reading the whole Tintin book before you return to ""Tintin - The Complete Companion"".Even if you have all of the Tintin books on hand, you may still find yourself feeling overwhelmed when Michael Farr begins to compare the various versions of the adventures. Unless you're a die-hard Tintin fanatic you probably don't have the old black and white versions of the early stories in your possession.I'm giving this book five stars, and it really does deserve it for the incredible amount of detail. But at the same time I'll warn once again that this is a book that is really intended for Tintin fanatics. For more down-to-earth Tintin fans such as myself it is over-kill. I would personally have preferred that Mr. Farr had written a shorter book that only touched on the highlights of his research.Incidentally, Michael Farr participates in a wonderful little video called ""Tintin et moi"" (""Tintin and me""). Unfortunately, this video is not readily available, but you may be able to find it on an Internet auction site. Highly recommended. (Not to be confused with the book of the same name.)Rennie Petersen",1

Illuminati (German Language),"Proofs of a Conspiracy discusses the rôle of Continental-style Freemasonry, Adam Weishaupt’s Illuminati, and Karl Friedrich Bahrdt’s German Union in disseminating the ‘Enlightenment’ ideas that led to the French Revolution, and is also the founding text of the modern conspiracy theory of history in the English language. Whatever criticisms may be made in relation to Robison’s methodology, Proofs . . . remains valuable today for several reasons: firstly, it provides a snapshot of Continental-style Freemasonry and secret societies in the 18th century; secondly, it is the earliest attempt, along with Barruel’s, to examine the rôle of conspiracies in a revolution; thirdly, it supplies insights into what we may call the ‘lowlands’ of the ‘Enlightenment’—not its eminent thinkers, but the odd and peculiar characters that were also active in this movement; and, finally, it presents a systematic critique of the ideals that in France led eventually to the Terror, thereby serving as a primary source for understanding opposition to the French Revolution and its core ideal of equality as a moral absolute. The Counter-Enlightenment arguments of authors like Robison are today more relevant than ever, since the politics of the West remain a legacy of his era, to the extent that even conservatives ultimately derive their political philosophy from Locke and rely on terminology based on the seating arrangements of the French National Assembly. Though it was soon forgotten, Proofs . . . has had a lasting impact; indeed, we live in times awash with conspiracy theories. Be it about the Illuminati, the Freemasons, the New World Order, 9/11, or master conspiracies involving all of the above, could the growth of conspiratology tell us something about democratic societies in liberal modernity?

It's My Life Now: Starting Over After an Abusive Relationship or Domestic Violence,"Those who have never experienced an abusive or violent relationship often believe that upon finding a way out, victims’ difficulties are solved: their life is good, they are safe, and recovery will be swift. However, survivors know that leaving is not the end of the nightmare -- it is the beginning of an often difficult and challenging journey toward healing and happiness. It’s My Life Now offers readers the practical guidance, emotional reassurance, and psychological awareness that survivors of relationship abuse and domestic violence need to heal and reclaim their lives after leaving their abusers. Since its publication in 2000, It's My Life Now has been highly successful as a working manual for survivors who are starting their lives over after an abusive relationship. This valuable book combines direction on practical and emotional issues with worksheets and self-exploration exercises. Now, in the second edition, Dugan and Hock include updated information and resources while encompassing a wider range of individuals and the relationships in which abuse and violence occur. The new edition also provides a new emphasis on safety assessment, which has increasingly been shown to be a critical factor in recovery. In addition, this new edition includes current resources and information about organizations for victims along with revised and enhanced strategies to help survivors move forward on the path of recovery.","['Meg Kennedy Dugan', 'Roger R.

In fact, if you only have the money for one ""recovery from abuse"" book, this one is the one to get. It covers every type of abuse, even spiritual abuse, which was very relevant to my experiences in a bizarre cultic marriage in which I was beaten over the head with the Bible and told to ""submit"" all the time. The tone that the book is written in is wonderful. It is neither ""oh, you poor pathetic baby"" or ""get over it, toots"" but strikes exactly the right tone--empowering and empathetic but not patronizing or overbearing.The book helps you not only analyze what happened to you and why, but gets you into the healing process. This book helped me quit beating myself up for ending up with and staying with an abuser (and having SIX children with him into the bargain), for still having feelings for my abusive husband, and for being tempted to go back. Some of the exercises at the end of the chapters were kind of silly, and I skipped them, but some were excellent. The exercise that helped me the most was the one that helped me to look back and remember why I fell in love with that chump to begin with. It WASN'T because I am brainless.The absolute best thing about this book, in my opinion, is the final chapter. Prior to reading it, I had no idea how in the world I managed to marry an abusive control freak and was scared to death of getting hooked by another one. This chapter really helped me feel capable of choosing another partner who is not abusive. The author tells you exactly what danger signs to look for. I missed every one of them the first time, but I won't miss them again!",1

My daughter was evaluated by a Speech and Language pathologist who told me she needed therapy and was a high risk for a learning disability. I got the written evaluation, but had nothing to help me review it critically until I got this book. This book has been a tremendous help in that area. It discusses how an evaluation should proceed and what the test scores really mean. It gives the parent a tremendous amount of very useful information in the speech, language and listening areas. It also gives you benchmarks, by age, of where your child should be in those areas. All this is done briefly, succintly. This book made sense of an area that I found so confusing. The information found in this book will be useful to the parent of any child suspected of having a speech, language or listening delay or disorder. It also helps parents seek assistance in these areas. Each potential problem is discussed individually, as well as different types of treatment for those problems. If you have even the slightest reason to suspect your child has an issue in these areas, or an educator or speech and language pathologist is telling you your child does, you must, must read this book. It will provide you with valuable information and enable you to speak intelligently so that you may better help your child.",1

GIVENS. In fact, one of the reasons I searched Amazon was to see if they were offering other programs by Mr Givens.My introduction to Givens was back in 1988 at a lecture he did at the WOODLANDS IN Wilkes Barre, PA. I subsequently bought his first book &quot;WEALTH WITHOUT RISK&quot; After the Bible, I feel that Wealth without Risk is the most significant book that I have ever read!That book gave me the confidence to challenge financial decisions that I had heretofore been leaving up to 'THE PRO'S&quot; My ignorance was their bliss.My first order of business was to substantially revamp my auto insurance. Raising the deductible to $1,000 from $50 that my agent suggested for me. I also dropped towing and all of the duplicate things. My agent wasn't very happy and did everything she could to discourage me. At that time in PA we were also required to have PIP. I be! lieve that I was one of the few people that knew that you could raise your deductible on PIP and thereby reduce premiums even lower. Now thank GOD, PIP is not required at all in our state. Which brings me to the question; 'if this PIP was so great and so necessary, what did our state drop it and why did our agents try to psh it down our throats?&quot;I also went on to raise my deductible's on my homeowners insurance and health insurance plan at work.I raised my health insurance deductible to $1,000. This reduced my premiums to zero. I cashed out the cash value life insurance policies (all four on myself, my spouse and our children) replacing my life insurance with a Term policy. I also bought drastically reduced term life policies for my spouse, and children (just to cover funeral expences). I also got rid of the mortgage life insurance on our mortgage loan, credit life on our car loans and cancelled extended warranty on tools and a vcr that we bought.I had som! e fee based mutual funds that were sold to me by &quot;ONE! OF THE PRO'S&quot;. I transferred those funds to a No-Load Fund recommended in WEALTH WITHOUT RISK saving 6% in commissions and actually getting better returns doing it myself using 'THE MONEY MOVEMENT STRATEGY&quot;as advised in WEALTH WITHOUT RISK.Possibly, the most satisfaction was getting my tax situation under control. After reading through the tax section, I am now in control! I know exactly what to do. I was one of those millions of Americans who loaned their money to the government interest free and thought it was great to get a refund each year. Now that money is working for me! The savings has helped me to pay off a 30 yr home mortgage in 12 years. Go from 4% contributions to 15% in my employers 401(k) plan, set up a college education fund for our children, amass a net worth that would have previously taken m entire life to create, drive newer model cars at less cost than our old &quot;clunkers&quot; have better protection at less cost and are contr! olling our own destiny instead of being controlled by others.Wealth without Risk was a Godsend for us. We went on to buy Mr Givens other books; Financial Selfdefense, More Wealth without Risk (The updated version of Wealth with Risk) and SuperSelf.I would like someday to meet Mr Givens, to shake his hand and thank him for the role he has played in upgrading my and my families financial lives to a level that we never could have dreamed of or achieved without his help.

Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling,"Beginning with a handful of members in 1830, the church that Joseph Smith founded has grown into a world-wide organization with over 12 million adherents, playing prominent roles in politics, sports, entertainment, and business. Yet they are an oddity. They are considered wholesome, conservative, and friendly on one hand, and clannish, weird, and self-righteous on the other. Mormonism: A Very Short Introduction explains who Mormons are: what they believe and how they live their lives. Written by Richard Lyman Bushman, an eminent historian and practicing Mormon, this compact, informative volume ranges from the history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to the contentious issues of contemporary Mormonism. Bushman argues that Joseph Smith still serves as the Mormons' Moses. Their everyday religious lives are still rooted in his conceptions of true Christianity. They seek revelation to solve life's problems just as he did. They believe the authority to seal families together for eternity was restored through him. They understand their lives as part of a spiritual journey that started in a ""council in heaven"" before the world began just as he taught. Bushman's account also describes the tensions and sorrows of Mormon life. How are Mormons to hold on to their children in a world of declining moral standards and rampant disbelief? How do rational, educated Mormons stand up to criticisms of their faith? How do single Mormons fare in a church that emphasizes family life? The book also examines polygamy, the various Mormon scriptures, and the renegade fundamentalists who tarnish the LDS image when in fact they're not members. In a time when Mormons such as Mitt Romney and Harry Reid are playing prominent roles in American society, this engaging introduction enables readers to judge for themselves how Mormon teachings shape the character of believers. About the Series: Oxford's Very Short Introductions series offers concise and original introductions to a wide range of subjects--from Islam to Sociology, Politics to Classics, Literary Theory to History, and Archaeology to the Bible. Not simply a textbook of definitions, each volume in this series provides trenchant and provocative--yet always balanced and complete--discussions of the central issues in a given discipline or field. Every Very Short Introduction gives a readable evolution of the subject in question, demonstrating how the subject has developed and how it has influenced society. Eventually, the series will encompass every major academic discipline, offering all students an accessible and abundant reference library. Whatever the area of study that one deems important or appealing, whatever the topic that fascinates the general reader, the Very Short Introductions series has a handy and affordable guide that will likely prove indispensable.",['Richard Lyman Bushman'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7WhY3r7UqT4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=7WhY3r7UqT4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Joseph+Smith:+Rough+Stone+Rolling&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Oxford University Press,2008-04-22,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7WhY3r7UqT4C&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],2.0,1400042704,22.72,AHXZGVD7YER0P,C.

But it does nothing of the sort. True, there is enough refreshingly candid information in the book to spook even the most devout Mormon, if he or she is unfamiliar with the controversy surrounding Smith's life. But Bushman ultimately whitewashes many of the most troubling aspects of that controversy. His depiction of the First Vision is utterly disingenuous, given a scholar of Bushman's caliber. It is problematic that Smith did not tell a consistent story from the time that the vision allegedly occurred, especially when we are dealing no less with a vision of God and Jesus as distinct beings. Most Mormons find it hard to accept that Smith did not tell a consistent story, although there are no small number of apologists waiting in the wings to soothe their troubled souls. He should have addressed the issue head on. So subtely does he treat the First Vision that one could read his depiction and utterly fail to understand how fundamental it is to the ideological, religious, and institutional foundations of the Mormon Church. His treatment of the Book of Abraham controversy, no less his treatment of the process whereby the Book of Mormon was translated, are equally deplorable. Other instances abound. I came away thinking that Bushman, a professional historian and practicing Mormon, wrote this book to dispell his own doubts about the late, great prophet's claims. He may have satisfied himself but not this reviewer.",1

North Korea: Another Country,"Depicted as an insular and forbidding police state with an “insane” dictator at its helm, North Korea—charter member of Bush’s “Axis of Evil”—is a country the U.S. loves to hate. Now the CIA says it possesses nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, as well as long-range missiles capable of delivering them to America’s West Coast. But, as Bruce Cumings demonstrates in this provocative, lively read, the story of the U.S.-Korea conflict is more complex than our leaders or our news media would have us believe. Drawing on his extensive knowledge of Korea, and on declassified government reports, Cumings traces that story, from the brutal Korean War to the present crisis. Harboring no illusions regarding the totalitarian Kim Jong Il regime, Cumings nonetheless insists on a more nuanced approach. The result is both a counter-narrative to the official U.S. and North Korean versions and a fascinating portrayal of North Korea, a country that suffers through foreign invasions, natural disasters, and its own internal contradictions, yet somehow continues to survive.",['Bruce Cumings'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pe86S4iCz34C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=pe86S4iCz34C&printsec=frontcover&dq=North+Korea:+Another+Country&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,The New Press,2011-05-10,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pe86S4iCz34C&source=gbs_api,['Political Science'],,156584873X,,A18HXCVW3FNDY3,Andrew,95/155,1.0,1070496000,A Nation only Bruce Cumings Could Love,"Bruce Cumings is the most facsinating and talented and insightful writer on Korean history by such a wide margain that you have trouble coming up with a name for the number two spot. This is not a good thing. Cumings' books are hard to put down --except for the times they fly out of your hands across the room in rage. You can't ignore Cumings' books, but you can't always counterbalance and/or innoculate yourself to his intense anti-American, leftist bent --and his strange, sick affinity toward North Korea.One of the things that Cumings in his writing has consistantly had wrong about Korea is the history of the hades-on-earth that was/is North Korea. For decades Cumings has been on a mission to prove that North Korea is a poor, picked on, misunderstood nation. Imagine the apologists for Stalin in the 1930s, who gushed about the power of the proletariat while millions perished and you are close. Close. Cumings does, usually in footnotes, touch upon tiny little things like North Korean gulags and little facts like that the state controls every single aspect of the people's lives from where they are allowed to live to what they are allowed to think.I once met a communist German doctor who went to North Korea with Doctors Without Borders. He came back a year later more hawkish than a hundred Donald Rumsfelds. What changed his mind? It wasn't so much the operations on children performed without anestheisia and rusty scapels he saw on a daily basis. It was the fact that he diagonsed nearly the entire population as showing symptons of extreme anxiety disorders. He found living in North Korea literally scares people to an early death.Nothing this real in all of Cumings, (though he does provide graphic accounts of misdeeds by American soldiers who defend wealthy and free South Koreans from their Northern brethren).What do you get instead? First, you get Cumings tired old canard that North Korea didn't start the Korean War and that all of Korea would now be a happy little China if Truman had let Kim Jong Il gobble the entire Korean peninsula in 1950. Yeah right, and Kim Jong Il really is the tallest, sexiest man in Asia. What about the recently uncovered Soviet archives that have Stalin signing off on Kim Il Son's request for war? Cumings would rather talk about unpaid parking tickets by off-duty American soldiers in Seoul.Then Cumings gushes about how North Korea really was doing great in the 1960s, with a higher standard of living than South Korea. So what? More North Koreans starved to death in the 1990s than died during the Korean War. South Korea is an economic juggernaut. South Koreans literally throw out more food than North Koreans produce. You never get a statement that simple, that honest in 500 pages of Cumings.Cumings also provides a very long, very pointless analysis of North Korean propaganda. His point? North Korean state rantings contain as much Confucius as Marx. Confucius, I'm sure, would appreciate that one. Interesting stuff, Bruce. But what about the gulags?But all that is prologue to Cumings' latest fantasy: Bush should lay off North Korea and give them billions of dollars with no strings attached. You see, according to Cumings, North Korea is logical and stable, but could eviscerate Seoul in a heartbeat if we don't pay it protection. Ipso facto our only choice is to subsidize Stalin's obscene gesture from beyond the grave in perpetuity --with help from the Japanese. On top of that Cumings believes, hold onto your seats, that the American taxpayer has a moral obligation to pay Kim Jong Il money that other nations have to work for because we wouldn't let his daddy have the whole Korean enchilada. Now you know why Cumings has never had a visa request turned down by Pyongyang.",1

Is overpopulation endangering the world's economies? Are we losing forests and fish? Are we all in danger from acid rain, water pollution, chemicals, global warming, air pollution?That is part of 'the Litany,' fears that Bjorn Lomborg, author of The Skeptical Environmentalist, says are based on faulty information. The heavily-documented, best-selling book challenges the basic assumptions, methods and mathmatical models which underlie much of the gloom and doom we read today.He thoroughly punctures most environmentalist groups' major theories, which they often present as facts, or future horrifying scenarios. A statistics professor at the University of Aarhus in Denmark, he didn't believe the optimism of the late economist Julian Simon who analyzed environmental trends.Lomborg, a self-described ""old left-wing Greenpeace member"" and concerned environmentalist, set out to challenge Simon's view of the future. But, he found out Simon was right.With the scorn and anger of one betrayed, Lomborg criticizes some famous environmental spokesmen, whom he believes misuse data to deceive the public into supporting their causes. And he shows news stories taking the worst of the predictions and expanding on them. He accepts that man-made global warming is real, but shows that forecasts of drastic climate change ""are not plausible.""""Well, what's so wrong with that?"" some might say. ""We have to get people's attention. If it saves one fish, it's worth it.""Lomborg disagrees and has a compelling argument about what is wrong with that attitude.""The constant repetition of the Litany and the often heard environmental exaggerations [have] serious consequences,"" he writes. ""It makes us scared and it makes us more likely to spend our resources and attention solving phantom problems while ignoring real and pressing (possibly non-environmental) issues.""We have an example of that from Oregon, in this year of grief and bankruptcy which followed the government's decision to shut off irrigation water in the Klamath Basin. Turns out the shutoff was unnecessary.In a just-released report, a National Academy of Sciences review committee concluded, ""there is presently no sound scientific basis for"" cutting off the water. The committee found the government's underlying scientific assumptions and methodology lacking.No one in Klamath Falls was surprised, just as they weren't surprised when they heard charges that government workers faked lynx presence in Washington forests.Lomborg wouldn't have been surprised either. A problem he notes among those pushing the Litany is that they pick and choose figures they want to use, selecting for example, the two or three downward trending years in a decades long upward trend. Examples are world grain yields and world exports of goods.The 'crises' that have enriched so many scientists and researchers living on government and foundation grants disappear under his analysis. He suggests that the only reasonable way to create accurate public perceptions is to use worldwide figures to account for both positive and negative trends for any given issue.""Whether we are talking about food, raw materials or energy, no shortages of resources seem to be forthcoming, no serious problems for the continued growth of production and welfare are in the offing,"" Lomborg writes.Now, don't you feel better?",1

"Intelligence, Genes, and Success: Scientists Respond to THE BELL CURVE (Statistics for Social Science and Public Policy)","A scientific response to the best-selling The Bell Curve which set off a hailstorm of controversy upon its publication in 1994.

Now I'm even more convinced. In fact, nothing could possibly better confirm the essential validity of the Bell Curve's claims than the fact, behind all the self-fueling sound and fury it provoked, and behind the holier-than-thou pretentions to be &quot;debunking,&quot; &quot;refuting,&quot; and &quot;flattening&quot; the Bell Curve, the careful reader cannot help but notice a striking absence of real, substantive objections to it.

"Intelligence, Genes, and Success: Scientists Respond to THE BELL CURVE (Silver Burdett Professional Publications)","Wat zou er gebeuren als we uit zouden vinden dat alle wetmatigheden uit de wiskunde eigenlijk willekeurig en inconsistent waren? Wat als we kennis zouden maken met een taal van buitenaardse wezens die onze perceptie van tijd voor altijd zou veranderen? Wat zou er gebeuren als we een toren van Babel zouden bouwen die echt tot in de hemel reikt? Dit soort vragen stelt Ted Chiang in zijn verhalen, die je nog lang aan het denken zetten. Ted Chiang schrijft één verhaal per twee jaar. Zijn manier van schrijven combineert precisie en wetenschappelijke belangstelling met een enorm verteltalent.

Useful Idiots - How Liberals Got It Wrong in the Cold War and Still Blame America,"The original BESTSELLER from nationally syndicated columnist Mona Charen! Who’s on the wrong side of history? The liberals who are always willing to blame America first and defend its enemies. They've tried to rewrite history, but Mona Charen won't let them as she calls out liberal hypocrisy during the Cold War and afterward; from DC elites like Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, and Jimmy Carter to Hollywood celebs like Woody Allen, Jane Fonda, and Martin Sheen to academic snobs like Noam Chomsky, Susan Sontag, and many more.

In Useful Idiots, she delineates the anti-anticommunism leftist contingent of the 80's that now claims to have always been for the overthrow of communism. Hmm...kind of rings a bell with Iraq - the Monday morning quarterback liberals saying how they knew we would win, but they just didn't want to say it beforehand. Yeah, right.When it comes to classic liberalism, are the liberals really liberal? Are they the ones instituting change or fighting it tooth and nail? In recent years, the latter rings true. The so-called ""liberals"" want to fight tax cuts for working Americans, condone the indiscriminate torture, rape, and genocide of innocent Iraqis, increase big government, eliminate faith-based initiatives, play the race card, filibuster judicial nominees interminably, decry the merit of school vouchers despite sending their kids to private schools, proudly proclaim a former KKK member as one of their leadesr, and, when in doubt, whine that they're being called ""unpatriotic"" when they do espouse their nonsense rhetoric.In the classical sense of the word, conservatives are the real liberals(but we're not useful idiots like Hillary) - the ones pressing for change and reform in government - i.e. Campaign Finance Reform via John McCain & tax cuts to put money back where it belongs - in the hands of the people who made it - not a Marxist redistribution of the wealth.",0

The Archaeology of Knowledge and the Discourse on Language,"Madness, sexuality, power, knowledge—are these facts of life or simply parts of speech? In a series of works of astonishing brilliance, historian Michel Foucault excavated the hidden assumptions that govern the way we live and the way we think. The Archaeology of Knowledge begins at the level of ""things aid"" and moves quickly to illuminate the connections between knowledge, language, and action in a style at once profound and personal. A summing up of Foucault's own methadological assumptions, this book is also a first step toward a genealogy of the way we live now. Challenging, at times infuriating, it is an absolutey indispensable guide to one of hte most innovative thinkers of our time.",['Michel Foucault'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jSa7QzfcCK0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=jSa7QzfcCK0C&pg=PP1&dq=The+Archaeology+of+Knowledge+and+the+Discourse+on+Language&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Vintage,2012-07-11,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jSa7QzfcCK0C&source=gbs_api,['Philosophy'],,B000HTB8GE,,,,95/128,5.0,953078400,Fascinating failure,"Let's be childish enough to use coarse categories: &quot;Discipline&amp;Punish&quot; is Foucault's most beautiful book. &quot;The Order of Things&quot; is the most brilliant (that's why it made him a star). Let's also say &quot;The History of Sexuality&quot; is his most exciting book. Then &quot;The Archaeology of Knowledge&quot; is the most fascinating: it is Foucault's attempt to write a theory of what he is doing. And it is a brilliant failure: this is the only time that we see Foucault, the master of brilliant formulation, completely naked. It is endearing to watch how he is trying to write a piece of philosophical theory, while all his other books demonstrate how unnecessary such theory is.This is no light reading and the English translation is barely comprehensible. I bet that there is a serious mistranslation on any given page. With good translations at hand, some notorious readers (Foucault lovers and Foucault enemies alike) might actually have understood what the words &quot;discourse&quot; and &quot;dispositif&quot; mean. Countless articles and books would not have been written. That's why a good German translation would have been even more desirable (the one in print is as miserable as the English one, same bet)...",1

Sadly, I found the beautifully designed cover, illustrations and quips on the back of the dustjacket to be the best part. Yes the author shares ideas on how a bombshell behaves, eats etc. But all the examples are dated, and the author fails to translate them to today's society. If I were to wear some of the outfits the author suggests, like a large, bold print polka dotted dress with super high heels shopping I am sure I would get stares but they would not be flattering ones. The author Laren Stover uses Elizabeth Taylor, Jayne Mansfield and Marilyn Monroe frequently as examples through out the text. Certainly these women are renowed for their beauty and style. But what played then doesn't work now, even for a bombshell. Had the author also used more comtemporary &quot;stars&quot; with style and glamour such as Jodie Foster or Sharon Stone and reported on how these ladies imbue star quality and that bombshell quality to their lives, the book would be much more relevant. Suggesting that a bombshell goes on a diet as her doctor won't give her anymore pills is an insult to all modern bombshells who know the best way to lose weight is a good support group and everything in moderation. The movies a bombshell watches, books a bombshell reads, and especially the clothes a bombshell wears according to the author are in many cases limited and old fashioned. Many of the perfumes the author suggests a bombshell use are way too heavy for today's modern times. This book is so beautifully designed and so well conceived it's a great disappointment that it fails at its attempt. Should the author care to make it relevant to today and show the reader how to incorporate sassiness and style and charm into today's world it would be an excellent, fun read. But this little book will not help anyone fufill their bombshell aspirations!",1

I am not doubting Ehrman's credentials - he was a student of Metzger - but he has an agenda, and that is evident in his additions to this edition. His feminism and radical view of early Christianity, as evidenced in his many other works, mars a classic work that deserved better treatment. Trust me, Metzger's theology is not shared by Ehrman. And his theology comes through, although textual criticism should not be agenda driven. I know that I will be skewered by some readers, but in my opinion a classic in the field has been marred by an editor who wants to steer readers away form the facts and toward his bias.If you don't know what I am talking about, just read his ""Orthodox Corruption of Scripture"" and his ""Misquoting Jesus.""Give me back the third edition of this work - and spare me the musings of a man who admits he now denies the faith he once espoused.",1

The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth,"As an intelligent woman, you are probably used to learning as much as you can before making major decisions. But when it comes to one of the most important decisions of your life--how you will give birth—it is hard to gather accurate, unbiased information. Surprisingly, much of the research does not support common medical opinion and practice. Birth activist Henci Goer gives clear, concise information based on the latest medical studies. The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth helps you compare and contrast your various options and shows you how to avoid unnecessary procedures, drugs, restrictions, and tests.

"The Marketing of Evil: How Radicals, Elitists, and Pseudo-Experts Sell Us Corruption Disguised As Freedom",,,,,,,,,,1581824599,14.86,ADES8B01WRPI3,"Bryan E. Leed ""Jesus says, 'Go and Sin No More!""",95/115,5.0,1130889600,"""Neutrality"" is not neutral--it's collaboration! says author David Kupelian","""Marketing is the application of the knowledge of human psychology to the task of persuasion."" (p.99)--author David Kupelian.This is a great book that points out a lot of things to consider for conservatives and Christians to better understand our sinful culture and how our society got so bad in the last half century.""A well-known Bible verse says, 'Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!' (Isaiah 5:20). Indeed, this book is about how evil is packaged and perfumed to look good--and good to appear evil.I read and listen a lot to Christian conservatives in their books and on the radio, so a lot of this is review for me, but it is a great place to start if you are just now getting interested in turning around our culture. But there are also plenty of little details that I found enlightening, even though I already have been exposed to the larger topics. For example, I did not know that AIDS was originally called 'Gay-Related Immunodeficiency Disease' (GRID), until homosexuals pressured the medical community to switch the name to AIDS (p.20), to take the onus off of sodomy. Even the medical community is susceptible to the negative influence of immoral pressure groups, which in turn effects our culture.David Kupelian has a good chapter on the judicial activist, athiest LIE of Separation of Church & State. He writes how this untrue concept has been used to turn America into a de facto atheistic, secular state!""You rarely hear the actual wording of the First Amendment anymore. But ""separation of church and state"" is one of those phrases that roll off the tongues of judges and journalists so easily and so often that most of us assume it's in the Constitution."" (p.55)""...in making any reference to God or biblical principles off-limits for those we've entrusted with this nation's government and charting its future course, do you realize what we are doing? We are deluding ourselves into believing there is some neutral ground between good and evil, and that this is where the government is supposed to be."" ""When Jews are being gassed and cremated down the street, 'neutrality' is not neutral--it's collaboration."" (p.58)Kupelian makes a good observation about how the 1960's selfish, self-obsessed ""liberation"" movements negatively rotted our culture. ""A generation later, the various 'liberation' movements--sexual liberation, women's liberation, gay liberation, and so on--have blossomed into rampant infidelity, divorce and family breakdown, gender confusion, AIDS, abortion, and other mammoth problems."" (p.89)Kupelian points out how virtually all of our society's current ills can be traced back to the disregard and distate towards traditional family values, most notably the en vogue concept of fathers being unnecessary. Then the government steps in to pick up the slack of broken, fatherless homes, and the population becomes dependent on the SECULAR government instead of the traditional, bread-winning father figure. If you want to be dependent on the government, the liberal left wants to help you become dependent on the government, so they can then enforce secular atheism on the population, but if you want to be happily married in a traditional family, you are on your own. These government entities are self-perpetuating. These social workers are out of work if there are not enough famililes needing to depend on them. It sounds like a too sinister, crazy concept, but think about it. It's true!He also writes about the secular public school system, to beware of what they are teaching our kids. ""Of course, the main factor keeping most American children in government schools is that they're free. So isn't free schooling a good thing? Sure. Free food is great too, but not if it's been poisoned. The governments' schools are free in the same way everything else the government does is free--you're forced to pay for it with your hard-earned taxes or you go to prison."" (p.163)The most bracingly new things I learned from this book came from the abortion chapter. ""What if reporters and editors cut through the high-flying rhetoric of civil rights and constitutional freedom and women's health and brought the issue down to little, perfectly formed human babies--three thousand of them every day...being painfully ripped apart, suctioned, chemically burned, sliced up, or decapitated?"" (p.187)""In one of the most successful marketing campaigns in modern political history, the 'abortion rights' movement--with all of its emotionally compelling catchphrases and powerful political slogans--has succeeded in turning what once was a crime into a fiercely defended constitutional right."" (.189)Kupelian rightly compares America's tolerance and support of abortion to the WWII era German citizens who let the Jewish Holocaust take place--both then and now, normal citizens were tricked by the marketing of evil as acceptable. Too many people think that if something is legal--even murder of innocent, defenseless human beings--then it must be moral, too. But remember, in a Godless, atheist government and culture, there is no morality.The author talks a bit about how American Christians let too much of this happen without any vocal opposition, or any kind of opposition at all. Though, I wish he would have spent more pages expounding what we American Christians must do to turn things around in God's Country.Sometimes the author digresses off the topic, about himself or his family, and this kind of loses the momentum, even though he eventually brings the story into the topic of conversation for that chapter. Also, sometimes I don't completely agree with his smaller details of theology, or culture. But overall, I generally agree with what he writes and this book is a great and enlightening page-turner.",1
Invisible (Ivy Malone Mystery Series #1),"She's not your average crime fighter! Ivy Malone has a curiosity that sometimes gets her into trouble, and it's only aggravated by her discovery that she can easily escape the public eye. So when vandals romp through the local cemetery, she takes advantage of her newfound anonymity and its unforeseen advantages as she launches her own unofficial investigation. Despite her oddball humor and unconventional snooping, Ivy soon becomes discouraged by her failure to turn up any solid clues. And after Ivy witnesses something ominous and unexplained, she can't resist putting her investigative powers to work again. Even the authorities' attempts to keep Ivy out of danger and her nosy neighbor's match-making schemes can't slow her down. But will the determination that fuels this persistent, quirky sleuth threaten her very safety? ""I laughed out loud.

I was also glad to see a book featuring an elderly female protaganist, as that doesn't happen often! However, I figured out the mystery part very early on, and anyone who reads mysteries will likely do so as well. The rest of the book was just uncomfortable and sort of boring. About a 1/4 of the way through, I realized Ivy was talking and thinking about God a lot. About 1/2 way through, I realized Ivy been to church and involved in religious discussions with no real substance for a good portion of the story. But it was when Ivy talked about when she ""accepted Jesus Christ as [her] personal savior"" that I felt truly duped. I don't mind religious characters, particularly if discussion is an essential part of their development, but this was very clearly, and very simply, a Christian book. The summary provided by Amazon gave no indication of this, and the reviews I skimmed didn't highlight it, either.There's also a generous dose of slut-shaming in the story. (ZOMG! A clingy dress! With a slit!)I admit I'm not the target audience for this story, but I felt I should share my experience in case others who don't want to spend their reading time on a mediocre mystery with a distinctly Christian bend should find themselves downloading it.",1
"Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compasionate Conservatism Who Gives, Who Doesn't, and Why It Matters","We all know we should give to charity, but who really does? In his controversial study of America's giving habits, Arthur C. Brooks shatters stereotypes about charity in America-including the myth that the political Left is more compassionate than the Right. Brooks, a preeminent public policy expert, spent years researching giving trends in America, and even he was surprised by what he found. In Who Really Cares, he identifies the forces behind American charity: strong families, church attendance, earning one's own income (as opposed to receiving welfare), and the belief that individuals-not government-offer the best solution to social ills. But beyond just showing us who the givers and non-givers in America really are today, Brooks shows that giving is crucial to our economic prosperity, as well as to our happiness, health, and our ability to govern ourselves as a free people.",['Arthur C.

The appendix and notes section of the book is large and thorough. Furthermore, Brooks takes the time to explain complex analysis of charity and simplify it for everyone.The main point that stood out to me was religious people are the real givers; it doesn't matter what their voting preference is. If you have faith in the Almighty you're more likely to love (""charity"" according to 1 Corinthians ch 13) your neighbor.The one negative is that the book has a political slant. No, it doesn't say we need to vote conservative and Brooks goes as far as even challenging liberals to change their philanthropic ways. But, it seems as if everything in our society revolves around politics.Brooks is a clever writer that uses common language. The chapters are well thought out and the book is short enough to digest in one reading. I recommend this book to all non-profit organizations, economics students, and anyone looking to affirm their faith in charity.",1
Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships (Random House Large Print),"Emotional Intelligence was an international phenomenon, appearing on the New York Times bestseller list for over a year and selling more than five million copies worldwide. Now, once again, Daniel Goleman has written a groundbreaking synthesis of the latest findings in biology and brain science, revealing that we are “wired to connect” and the surprisingly deep impact of our relationships on every aspect of our lives. Far more than we are consciously aware, our daily encounters with parents, spouses, bosses, and even strangers shape our brains and affect cells throughout our bodies—down to the level of our genes—for good or ill. In Social Intelligence, Daniel Goleman explores an emerging new science with startling implications for our interpersonal world. Its most fundamental discovery: we are designed for sociability, constantly engaged in a “neural ballet” that connects us brain to brain with those around us. Our reactions to others, and theirs to us, have a far-reaching biological impact, sending out cascades of hormones that regulate everything from our hearts to our immune systems, making good relationships act like vitamins—and bad relationships like poisons. We can “catch” other people’s emotions the way we catch a cold, and the consequences of isolation or relentless social stress can be life-shortening. Goleman explains the surprising accuracy of first impressions, the basis of charisma and emotional power, the complexity of sexual attraction, and how we detect lies. He describes the “dark side” of social intelligence, from narcissism to Machiavellianism and psychopathy. He also reveals our astonishing capacity for “mindsight,” as well as the tragedy of those, like autistic children, whose mindsight is impaired. Is there a way to raise our children to be happy? What is the basis of a nourishing marriage? How can business leaders and teachers inspire the best in those they lead and teach? How can groups divided by prejudice and hatred come to live together in peace? The answers to these questions may not be as elusive as we once thought. And Goleman delivers his most heartening news with powerful conviction: we humans have a built-in bias toward empathy, cooperation, and altruism–provided we develop the social intelligence to nurture these capacities in ourselves and others.",['Daniel Goleman'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mEKCDGXHVmMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=mEKCDGXHVmMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Social+Intelligence:+The+New+Science+of+Human+Relationships+(Random+House+Large+Print)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Bantam,2006-09-26,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mEKCDGXHVmMC&source=gbs_api,['Psychology'],16.0,0739326791,,A3JX8YZV9E1Y84,A Customer,95/114,5.0,1165017600,WOW- Every Page is WORTHWHILE,"I read a book a day, and have for 30 years. I sometimes read a book looking for that one scintillating page, sometimes it's just a paragraph, in some books only a sentence. I begin by reading the inside cover of the book. I then scan the preface, and turn to any random page usually deep in the book. I start to read. Whether something strikes my fancy or not, I turn to another page somewhere else in the book. I probably look at five pages this way. Within those five pages, I can tell if I am going to like this book.With Goleman's Social Intelligence, every page was fascinating. I literally had difficulty putting it down. This whole book is jam-packed with fabulous and interesting information on topics, which I feel are important to all of us as human beings. Some of this material has been covered in other places in other ways. When Goleman covers it, it seems so fresh.His work seems to indicate that as human beings, we are DESIGNED FOR SOCIALIBILITY. Our emotions are CONTAGIOUS. Now there's a thought I have never thought about. You can catch a cold; we all know that. What I didn't know is that I could literally catch somebody's emotional state.Yes, I know that classically trained psychoanalysts go through ""transference issues"" with their patients. That's not the point. What about being in a room with a group of very down people, and your soul picks up on it and accommodates them by making you depressed. This is what Goleman is writing about, and he gives example after example. The difference is that the author uses the phrase, ""TOXIC PEOPLE"".I have been fortunate in many of the friendships I have formed through the years. One of my friends is among the brightest people on earth. He is categorized as Mensa, Mensa, the top 1% of 1% of geniuses on earth. Several years ago when I was describing a relationship I had with another person, he said something so profound that it transformed me immediately. He said, ""You know, you think you can reach down into the murk, and pull that person out. You can't, you never will, THEY PULL YOU IN."" He was so right, so penetrating, so spot on dead accurate. You can't change TOXIC PEOPLE, and Goleman writes about this. They change you. You simply have to AVOID THEM.I loved Goleman's story of ""Yacht Envy"". He talked about being on a magnificent yacht in the Mediterranean Sea. Each person on board had a room fit for a king. The yacht was a converted commercial vessel of some kind, but beautifully decked out. On the coffee table in each room was a copy of a very special book on the world's most beautiful yachts. There was a piece of paper pointing to a certain page in the book, and on that page was a multiage color layout of the very yacht you were on.Goleman talks about how everybody felt so fortunate to be on this beautiful craft. Suddenly one morning, as the guests climbed the stairs to the deck, they saw this other yacht four times longer than the yacht they were on, close by. It absolutely dwarfed the ship they had all thought so highly of, and then there was the tender. The tender is an auxiliary ship used to service the yacht they were looking at. It brings provisions and other goods to the yacht. The tender was bigger than the yacht they were on. The author ends the story by saying, ""Is there such a thing as YACHT ENVY.""What you will learn from this book will blow you away. Some of the topics that I find fascinating and covered in detail in Social Intelligence include:Nourishing relationshipsReshaping our brains with enriching personal relationshipsForthrightness is the brain's DEFAULT responsePeople lying begin verbalizing 2/10ths of a second later than truth tellersA new explanation for Jung's concept of synchronicityI will leave you with this thought. You are probably familiar with MRI. The doctors use them medically to find tumors and so forth. There is a more complex machine called an fMRI which brain investigators are doing mind-boggling research with. As an example if you are wired up, and all of a sudden are expressing anger over something, a researcher can look at an MRI and see precisely what parts of the brain are lighting up during the emotional outburst. You can just guess at the possibilities of this work. It is covered thoroughly in this book as is over 100 other fabulous concepts. Read it, delight yourself, and don't put it down. Social Intelligence is COMPELLING.Richard Stoyeck",1

The Abs Diet: The Six-Week Plan to Flatten Your Stomach and Keep You Lean for Life,,,,,,,,,,B000BKHEOO,,A2EB6Y6W8OBWAZ,P. Lester,95/112,1.0,1226188800,"Bad Science, Bad Advice","While there are some good things in this book, its overall message is based on some bad science and its recommendations may lead you to gain weight, not lose it.The short version of this review is this: weight training + no calorie control = weight gain (both muscle and fat) for many (probably most) people. It's called ""bulking"" in the body building world, and for good reason.People buying a book called ""The Abs Diet"" probably want to lose fat, but for lots of them following the recommendations in this book will accomplish the exact opposite, and in fact you see that play out in some of the other one-star reviews of this book. For more on the science behind all this and some recommendations on better books for fat loss, read on ...(A) EXERCISE: The central thesis of this book is that you can lose fat through weight training. Build those muscles (like your abs) and watch the fat melt off. That explains the title (""The Abs Diet"").This theory is fundamentally flawed. The primary basis for the author's argument is a claim that muscle tissue consumes 50 calories per pound of muscle per day (actually he says ""up to,"" but that is easy to miss). According to this theory, if you add on a mere 10 pounds of muscle your metabolism will skyrocket by 500 calories per day and chew up all those unwanted fat pounds. The only problem with this is that, in reality, muscle tissue only consumes about 6 calories per pound per day. Fat tissue, meanwhile, also consumes about 2 calories per pound per day, so as you add muscle and lose fat, you will actually only make tiny changes in your daily calorie usage. And that daily calorie usage may very well drop, not increase, if you are losing a lot of fat.Second, he neglects to tell you how difficult it is to gain muscle and lose fat at the same time. It requires almost perfectly timed protein and carb boosts before and immediately after weight training, and even then, simply focusing on either muscle building or fat loss at one time, and switching back and forth (called bulking and cutting by body builders), may get you there faster. More generally, successful muscle building requires a calorie surplus, while fat loss requires a calorie deficit.Overall, research suggests that the track record of exercise as a fat-loss strategy is actually pretty mixed, and minimal for many (its track record is better when it comes to preventing fat regain, though). Any contribution to fat loss is most likely to occur in a calorie-restricted environment, where the primary value is in the calories burned during and after exercise and the resulting avoidance of muscle loss, rather than muscle building. But while this strategy may work in theory, in practice it makes many people hungrier, making them eat more and thereby negating much or all of the benefit. For lots of people, exercise actually correlates more with muscle gain and increased (not lower) body fat, which is reflected in the bulking and cutting strategy mentioned earlier.At best, this boils down to ""your mileage may vary."" If nothing else, it suggests that people who use exercise as a fat loss strategy should monitor their results to see if it is working as expected, preferably with measuring tape not a scale, since adding muscle will add pounds. My personal view is that exercise can contribute to fat loss when combined with calorie control, but this contribution is easily negated by poor dietary choices, which are far more important.(B) DIET: This brings us to the primary determinant of fat loss, getting your diet right. Simply put, you can exercise all you want, but if you don't get your diet right then don't bother. The author acknowledges the importance of diet and includes a lot of dietary advice in the book. Unfortunately, a lot of that advice is off the mark.First, the author completely glosses over the importance of controlling calories. Instead, he encourages you to ignore calories and just focus on eating certain ""power foods"", which he thinks will get you to consume fewer calories overall. Well, that may be true for some people but not for others. If you check the other one star reviews of this book, you will find plenty of people who gained weight following his recommendations. This probably isn't too surprising given the inclusion of peanut butter, nuts, and some other questionable items on his power food list. It is generally accepted that you need to reduce your net calorie consumption by 3,500 calories to lose a pound of body fat. How you accomplish this, though, matters a lot.The best diet is one that human beings evolved to eat. The bulk of this evolution happened before agriculture, and well before the more recent disaster known as the modern Western Diet. Our ideal diet is lots and lots of vegetables supplemented with some fish or meat as a source of protein (or some vegetarian equivalent if you prefer that, though as a species we are omnivores and thus meat eaters), with some whole fruit (not juice or dried fruit) thrown in occasionally. Everything else should either be eaten in moderation or not at all, and even meat and fish should be eaten in moderation. Generally speaking, you only need about 50-150 grams of protein per day, depending on your size and exercise habits. Anything more than that will slow fat loss without adding appreciably to muscle gain.Vegetables are the real stars in this diet. They feature both low calorie density and high fiber content. The first fills you up at a low calorie price and the second can slow down digestion (depending on whether it is soluble or insoluble fiber), thereby keeping you full longer. Coupled with a little protein, which has its own satiety properties, vegetables are anti-hunger dynamos.Let's pause to think about hunger for a moment. It is the bane of most diets, and yet it is a wholly natural feeling - nature's way of making sure we don't starve. Other animals seem to deal successfully with it, eating what they need to without getting fat. When confronted with an abundant food supply, most animals multiply and thrive. They don't get fat and slothful, features that would tend to get you eaten by a predator. Humans are the only animal for whom hunger is a problem. The reason is we aren't eating human food -- the plant and animal diets we evolved to eat.Once you realize this, it becomes pretty obvious what you need to avoid - any processed, manufactured food that does not exist in nature. This probably includes the grain and rice-based carbs that low-carb practitioners dislike so much (principally because they heighten insulin and promote fat storage). Indeed, there is a lot of evidence that our dietary problems began with the adoption of agricultural practices that produced bread, cereals, pasta, rice and similar foods. You should probably also reduce or eliminate dairy. The only milk humans probably should consume is mother's milk when we are babies (there is a reason many people are lactose intolerant, and our Paleolithic ancestors were probably not milking a lot of wild cows).But much more than the above foods, you truly need to avoid the manufactured techno-foods invented in the past few decades that are so packed with sugar, fat, salt, and calories. This includes most packaged foods in the supermarket and most food in most restaurants, particularly chains. Beyond the unusually high calorie density (well beyond that of the meat and vegetables we should be eating), many of these foods have been engineered to be so palatable that they actually trigger chemical reactions in our brains that are not terribly different from drugs. Sugar is particularly bad here, triggering dopamine and a variety of other chemicals associated with pleasure, which render it quite literally the crack cocaine of foods. There is a reason that food manufacturers add high fructose corn syrup to virtually everything, even foods you don't think of as sweet. You will be doing yourself a lot of good if you stop viewing these manufactured techno foods as food, and instead view them as the drugs they truly are.A lot of people have noted the explosion in obesity that has occurred in the U.S. since the early 1980s. Once you realize the effects that the foods we eat have on the brain, and couple that with their associated calorie density, it is pretty easy to see why this is true. A lot of the arguments between low-carb and low-fat diet enthusiasts miss this. Is eliminating donuts, ice cream, potato chips, French fries, and pizza from your diet low carb or low fat? It's both.In fairness, the dietary advice in this book doesn't take you that far astray from these principles (though, again the nuts and peanut butter recommendations are questionable, and low-carb enthusiasts probably won't like the whole grain and oatmeal recommendations). My more fundamental criticism is the earlier focus on weight training as an oversold dietary strategy, particularly when coupled with advice to ignore calories consumed. Muscle and fitness are good things, don't get me wrong, and if you are a sports enthusiast looking to get stronger or bulk up, it's good advice. But if you are looking to lose fat, this advice may be counter-productive. It's called the Abs-Diet, after all. This book is being marketed to people looking to lose fat. People in that category need to focus first and foremost on fixing their diets.Toward that end, here are some other books you should consider, instead of or in addition to this book:* The Paleo Diet, by Loren Cordain: This is the best set of dietary recommendations I have come across, and it is consistent with the recommendations found above.* The End of Overeating, by David Kessler: This book describes some of the brain chemistry issues associated with processed food.Also worth reading:* Time magazine, ""Why Exercise Won't Make You Thin"" (August 9, 2009): You should be able to find this article via Google. I don't necessarily agree with everything in it, but it does at least question the value of exercise as a primary fat loss strategy for everyone. A better article would have been ""Why Exercise (Alone) Won't Make You Thin,"" and stressed that while exercise can help, your diet is far more important. Either way, my advice is monitor and measure, and figure out what works for you.",0

The End of History and the Last Man,"Francis Fukuyama's controversial 1992 book The End of History and the Last Man demonstrates an important aspect of creative thinking: the ability to generate hypotheses and create novel explanations for evidence. In the case of Fukuyama's work, the central hypothesis and explanation he put forward were not, in fact, new, but they were novel in the academic and historical context of the time. Fukuyama's central argument was that the end of the Cold War was a symptom of, and a vital waypoint in, a teleological progression of history. Interpreting history as ""teleological"" is to say that it is headed towards a final state, or end point: a state in which matters will reach an equilibrium in which things are as good as they can get. For Fukuyama, this would mean the end of ""mankind's ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government."" This grand theory, which sought to explain the end of the Cold War through a single overarching hypothesis, made the novel step of resurrecting the German philosopher G.W.F. Hegel's theory of history - which had long been ignored by practical historians and political philosophers - and applying it to current events.",['Ian Jackson'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kEkrDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=kEkrDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+End+of+History+and+the+Last+Man&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,CRC Press,2017-07-05,http://books.google.nl/books?id=kEkrDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+End+of+History+and+the+Last+Man&hl=&source=gbs_api,,,B000K1V2D8,,A1RLYOPK16YXC1,Stacey M Jones,95/109,4.0,1032220800,A philosophical work about the world around us,"""The End of History and the Last Man"" by Francis Fukuyama has an apocalyptic-looking cover and a title that needs explication. But the book is not a doomsday scenario, quite the contrary, as the explanation of the title will show.Fukuyama, who is Bernard Schwartz Professor of International Political Economy at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University, published this work of political philosophy in 1992, and in it, he explains in a logical, well-considered progression why he believes that liberal democracy is the final resting point of progressive history, but that that very liberal democracy can render humanity as less than what it could be - comfort seeking, self-involved, ""men without chests.""The book, which could be subtitled ""I Love Hegel and Why You Should, Too,"" builds on Hegel's idea that there is a Universal, progressive History. This is to what Fukuyama is referring when he says that History has reached its end; he doesn't mean that nothing else will happen, but that the progression of History toward a universally beneficial system of government has culminated in liberal democracy. He defines liberalism - ""Political liberalism can be defined simply as a rule of law that recognizes certain individual rights or freedoms from government control"" and he defines those rights in three classes, civil rights, religious rights and political rights. He defines democracy as ""the right held universally by all citizens to have a share of political power, that is, the right of all citizens to vote and participate in politics.""His concentration on Hegel arises from Fukuyama's contention that we've been very conditioned by Karl Marx's influence to believe that most social and political problems come from economic and class differences. Fukuyama disagrees, saying that conflict comes from Hegel's theory that some people will risk their lives for prestige, or recognition. He writes that the aristocracy was created by such people - people who risked their lives for prestige and were able to enslave others. He writes that liberal democracy resolves the tension between slave and master because it makes the slaves their own masters.But he cautions that Nietzsche believed in war and conflict as a way for humanity to express its passions, and that without conflict (Fukuyama says that liberal democracies do not attack each other), humans will become soft, meaningless, passionless, ""men without chests."" Fukuyama does not advocate that people become ""last men,"" even though in this volume, he believes the End of History is being reached.I read this book because Thomas L. Friedman faulted it for ""not going far enough"" in ""The Lexus and the Olive Tree: Understanding Globalization,"" but I wouldn't agree with that. Friedman clearly owes a lot to Fukuyama, directly or indirectly, and the roots of many of Friedman's ideas are explicated very elegantly here.I find this book difficult to write about because it contains so many interrelated and complex ideas that are truly fascinating, including Fukuyama's views on the role of science in reaching the End of History. (In fact, in a newer book, ""Our Posthuman Future: Consequences of the Biotechnology Revolution,"" he writes that the End of History may not have been reached because the End of Science hasn't been reached.

Everything in this book, like everything done by software, are things that you could do without it... If you had an endless amount of time. This book will save you time, and time is the most precious of all comodities.The information contained in this book will save you time and is faiirly robust though it does not cover everything.One area that is extremely important that is just grazed over is avoiding disreputable bidders. A novice seller might think that it's good to get all bidders but the reality is that there are many bidders that will just make your life worse. Deadbeat bidders , stalkers, check bouncers etc.The best way to avoid these types are by what essentially amounts to a credit check on your bidders. The easiest way I have found to accomplish this is by just doing a scan on them at DeadbeatBuster.ComIt is a real time database of problem bidders on all internet auction sites and can be accessed by going to http://www.firewallx.com or by simply typing DeadbeatBuster.Com into your browsers address bar.You will instantly find out if one of your bidders has a history of not paying or other such information before your auction ends so that you can cancel their bid and sell it to the buyer with the good record.",1

No other introduction to computer science has a truer grasp of the &quot;soul&quot; of computer science. Not only that, but there is ALOT of useful theory in here, if you have the patience to look.But, the book suffers for dreadful writing and advocacy of a language that can be really quite a horror for beginning programmers. On one hand, the authors took an approach that should have been brilliantly successful. On the other, they did a terrible job explaining fairly simple ideas (or, rather, ideas that should have been simple.)But, the truth is SICP has SO MUCH to offer. Unfortunatedly, the book is only as educational as the CS professor who teaches it. It turns out that the Berkeley professor who said that SICP is &quot;the greatest CS book ever written&quot; is the finest CS teacher at Berkeley. Unfortunatedly, most CS professors are not even 1/10th as good as he is and therefore help make SICP a tortorous excursion.As a EECS major at Berkeley, I've come to realize just how important theory is in the field of CS. And to that end, I think it is as easily critical that theory should be taught with the utmost respect, not only for the field but the students. SICP is a brilliant master, but often a contemptuous teacher.",1
The Naked Capitalist,"Why? Why do some of the richest people in the world support communism and socialism? Why would they support what appears to be the pathway to their own destruction? Dr. Carroll Quigley of Harvard, Princeton and Georgetown Universities states that he has been associated with many of these dynastic families of the super-rich. He therefore writes as an authority on the world’s secret power structure. As Dr. Skousen reviews Carroll Quigley’s book Tragedy and Hope, he exposes the plans of these rich capitalists, who wish to mold and manipulate society according to their evil plans.

This is a story of a group of math whizzes, most of Asian descent, who used the art of card counting, worked as teams, and legally won as much as 4 million dollars during the few years they spent their weekends in the Vegas casinos, living the high life.They strapped thousands of dollars to their bodies with Velcro to get the cash onto planes, used false names, and were always on the lookout for Las Vegas personnel who would sometimes personally escort them out of the casinos. They also learned about the seediness of the gambling world, greed, the way the Vegas corporations work. Of course they all went through changes. And eventually, it had to come to an end. Some of it is kind of scary too. But mostly, it's about beating the odds and living with a constant adrenaline high.Well, reading this book is an adrenaline high of it's own.

Armchair Economist,"Revised and updated May 2012. In this revised and updated edition of Steven Landsburg’s hugely popular book, he applies economic theory to today’s most pressing concerns, answering a diverse range of daring questions, such as: Why are seat belts deadly? Why do celebrity endorsements sell products? Why are failed executives paid so much? Who should bear the cost of oil spills? Do government deficits matter? How is workplace safety bad for workers? What’s wrong with the local foods movement? Which rich people can’t be taxed? Why is rising unemployment sometimes good? Why do women pay more at the dry cleaner? Why is life full of disappointments?

Ryan ""Scott Ryan""",95/108,5.0,997056000,Tour the mind of an economist,"If you're remotely interested in economics, you should read this book; it's a hoot.Not too many books on economics could be described as a &quot;hoot.&quot; But Steven Landsburg, an economics professor at the University of Chicago when he wrote this book (now he's at the University of Rochester), has a delightfully sharp sense of humor and a gift for clear, logical exposition. He also doesn't in the least mind naming names when it comes to egregious economic fallacies and the people who commit them: he keeps a &quot;Sound and Fury file&quot; consisting of economic gaffes from the op-ed pages and he devotes a chapter to exposing the culprits.His theme is easily stated, and he states it on the first page: the substance of economic science is that people respond to incentives. &quot;The rest,&quot; he writes in deliberate imitation of Rabbi Hillel, &quot;is commentary.&quot;Landsburg fills the rest of the book with such commentary. His witty and occasionally sarcastic exposition deals neatly with such topics as why recycling paper doesn't really save trees; why certain statistics are not reliable measures of the &quot;income gap&quot; between rich and poor; why the GNP is not an especially accurate measure of national wealth; why unemployment isn't necessarily a bad thing; why taxes _are_ a bad thing; why real economists don't care about what's &quot;good for the economy&quot; or endorse the pursuit of monetary profit apart from personal happiness; and lots of other points that will no doubt be profoundly irritating to people who just _know_ he _can't possibly_ be right.For example, Landsburg is delightfully allergic to the claims of the &quot;environmental&quot; movement and recognizes it quite clearly as a strongly moralistic religion. And contrary to the opinions of some not terribly careful readers, he does distinguish firmly between the actual harm caused by pollution and the psychic harm caused by (e.g.) the use of automobiles to people who object in principle to such technology.Interestingly, Landsburg recognizes a problem here for his own cost-benefit approach: if economic efficiency with regard to utilitarian/consequentialist goods and bads were really the whole story, he notes, he should care about _both_ the physical harm and the psychic harm, and yet he doesn't.Which leads neatly into the other notable feature of this volume: Landsburg is stunningly forthright about the nature -- and the limits -- of cost-benefit analysis. Unlike some economists who like to pretend such analysis is value-free and involves no commitment to any particular view of morality, Landsburg is clear that cost-benefit analysis is quite unambiguously committed to one particular moral outlook (which he characterizes and describes very neatly). And he is keenly aware of its limitations, though he is not at all confident about what should replace it.The problem, roughly, is this (the following characterization is mine, not his). As Landsburg notes several times, cost-benefit analysis does not regard &quot;theft&quot; as a cost, since it merely transfers existing stuff from one person to another; society is no worse off on net after the theft than before it. (Of course theft entails _further_ costs that _do_ leave society worse off, but that's not the point here.) Economics, as Landsburg describes it, looks only at _outcomes_ and not at how we got to them. And even at that, it looks only at one abstract feature of such outcomes, namely, how much &quot;good&quot; there is in the aggregate.And yet most of us would say that &quot;society&quot; _is_ somehow worse off after a theft -- that there is some sort of &quot;moral cost&quot; involved in the theft itself quite apart from its further consequences, and that it makes a difference whose &quot;good&quot; is rightfully achieved or acquired and whose is not. (Some of us might even say that there is something illegitimate in comparing the thief's gain to the victim's loss in the first place.) In ordinary moral discourse, it matters very much how we arrived at a given state of affairs.If so, then economic science has two choices (this is still my opinion, not his). (1) It can throw those &quot;moral costs&quot; into the mix and deal with &quot;rights and wrongs&quot; in the same way it deals with &quot;goods and bads.&quot; In that case, the total &quot;good&quot; will take account of the number and quality of right acts vs. wrong acts. (2) It can ignore those &quot;moral costs&quot; and continue as before.In either case, economic science _as Landsburg presents it_ is simply insufficient as a guide to policy decisions. (Landsburg tends to acknowledge this, maintaining only that cost-benefit analysis is an important _part_ of whatever it is we need to make policy decisions.) And it is certainly not -- as Landsburg also recognizes in a wonderfully forthright chapter -- sufficient as a guide to personal conduct.So this volume gets five stars even though Landsburg doesn't have much to say about what should supplement cost-benefit analysis. It's a terrific introduction to economic thinking genreally, and it's also a clear and frank recognition of the limitations of such thinking at least as practiced by many mainstream economists.",1
The Rig Veda (Penguin Classics),"Gathers Vedic hymns about creation, death, sacrifice, ritual, and the various gods and characters of Indian mythology",['Wendy Doniger'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lqKwteD19U8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=lqKwteD19U8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Rig+Veda+(Penguin+Classics)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin,1981,http://books.google.com/books?id=lqKwteD19U8C&dq=The+Rig+Veda+(Penguin+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Hindu hymns'],4.0,0140449892,10.84,A2519788C514WB,"Ian M. Slater ""aylchanan""",95/108,5.0,1128470400,Ian Myles Slater on: Penguin's New Packaging,"This is a re-issue, in Penguin's current format, and with new cover art, of the Penguin Classics volume previously listed by Amazon as ""The Rig Veda: An Anthology of One Hundred Eight Hymns,"" published in 1981 (and as of October 2005, confusingly still available from Amazon), as translated and edited by Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty. That was her married name, since dropped, to the accompaniment of endless bibliographic and bookselling confusion. She is now known as Wendy Doniger, and is the ""Mircea Eliade Distinguished Service Professor of the History of Religions"" at the University of Chicago. (She has reported receiving mail with interesting combinations of names and titles.)Upon inspection, the ""new edition"" is revealed to be one of Penguin's cosmetic re-packagings to make the whole line uniform (and mostly quite handsome), and not one of the revised editions which have also been appearing as part of the same project. I offer here, with some modifications, my review of the 1981 edition (itself previously reissued in a larger format, with new cover art, some years ago, but also not otherwise changed).Meanwhile, I suggest trying the Amazon page for the older edition of ""The Rig Veda: An Anthology..."" if you are interested in a variety of responses by over a dozen other reviewers. And, again, don't let the title and name variations suggest that they are different books, of exactly the same length, from the very same publisher! (As a matter of fact, the actual front-cover title of these editions has been just ""The Rig Veda"" all along.)Under any form of her name, Wendy Doniger is a distinguished interpreter and translator of Vedic and classical Sanskrit texts, and of Indian religions in general. Her books are often witty, and at times quite dense with detail. She fully appreciates the playfulness of many versions of Hindu stories of the gods. (""Play"" being in fact an explicit theme in some of them.)In this volume she presents a selection of very ancient poems, in quite readable translations, and backs them up with detailed interpretive and bibliographic notes. It is a first-rate introduction to a very difficult body of literature, which, like the Bible and the Koran, is held sacred by a very large number of people. It is an intriguing and attractive look at the hymns and songs of ancient India, although this volume is at best an adjunct to an appreciation of the living religion, which certainly regards The Four Vedas (Rig, Yajur, Sama, and Atharva) as its basic canonical texts, but looks very different indeed to outsiders from the ancient beliefs and practices in archaic Sanskrit.Unfortunately, like the Koran, the Vedas are traditionally memorized, recited, cited, and sometimes explained, but not translated, which makes this book religiously problematic. Turning the mystical sounds of Sanskrit into readily intelligible words seems to strike some as sacrilege. At best, devotional readings are the only acceptable renderings. To the apparent distress of some true believers, Wendy Doniger tries to reconstruct what the poems meant when they were first recited, mainly (according to the early Sanskrit supplementary texts, the Brahmanas and Aranyakas) to accompany rituals; although some seem to have had other contexts.This is not their meaning to present-day Hindus, over three thousand years later, which would be an interesting topic in itself; but two of the other four canonical Vedic Samhitas (collections) are verses of the Rig Veda arranged for such liturgical use, so the attempt to apply this information to the poems is not some strange leap in logic by foreigners. Nor is the rigorous use of comparative grammar and analysis of sound-changes -- this was a science which really can be said, quite fairly, to have been learned by Europeans from the Sages of India, even if they have applied it in unexpected and non-traditional ways.Now, this is exactly what critical scholarship is supposed to be about. Anyone who finds in it a specific bias against Hinduism might take a close look at an issue of, say, ""The Journal of Biblical Literature."" Christians and Jews having been doing this sort of thing with their own sacred texts for a couple of hundred years (actually, although sporadically, rather longer).Now, I haven't studied Sanskrit. But I *have* compared her versions of a number of famous hymns to earlier English translations, to relatively recent treatments of passages in academic journals, and to transliterated Sanskrit texts (and also citations and variants outside the Rig Veda, traced in the digital version of Bloomfield's ""Vedic Concordance""), and even to the highly regarded German translation by Geldner (not a lot of help for me there...). I found that her renderings tend to be a bit sparse, or at least concise, compared to most, but she uses headnotes and end notes to fill up gaps by explaining implications, instead of interpolating extra words or phrases to make clear her understandings of passages.So I can't agree that she is willfully misrepresenting the originals.No, I think that the main problem with the volume, as the translator would probably acknowledge, is that it will leave the (non-devotional) reader hungry for more. There are only 108 (a sacred number) out of a canon of 1,028. She chose some of the most attractive poems, including most of the famous ones, and presented them in language free of late-Victorian pseudo-Biblical idioms. Although sometimes (not always) too formal to be truly colloquial -- we are, after all, looking at formal compositions, many very clearly ceremonial! -- they are hardly in what Hank Heifetz (a co-winner of the Ramanujan Book Prize for Translation of South Asian Languages) has called ""Indologese,"" either.Unfortunately, most of the other English versions, and all of the more-or-less complete ones, belong to the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and, besides these literary faults, are a century or so out of date; although still reprinted, even (or especially) in India. The e-book ""Rig Veda"" offered by Amazon from digiread may be the R.T.H. Grifffith translation of 1889, revised in 1896. The Kessinger e-book is Griffith's version, and, as I have described in a separate review, has the complete hymns, with some passages relegated by the translator to an appendix, but it omits the translator's valuable running notes. There was a one-volume Book-of-the-Month Club edition of it in 1992, with both all of the hymns and notes, and some appendices but apparently without some of Griffith's other apparatus; see ""Hinduism: The Rig Veda (Sacred Writings)"" by Ralph T.H. Griffith for the Amazon listing. (One hopes the digireads version isn't the incomplete H.H. Wilson rendering, the first installments of which are from 1850!)Readers without Sanskrit, like me, can neither rely upon these and other old translations, nor easily find corrections for specific passages. Many pieces that aren't included in this Penguin selection are only too likely to be missed by those of us who have seen references to particular hymns, and would like to have a better idea of what they are about. But I'm grateful to have what is here.",1

But I am equally uncomfortable when around my anti-war friends who, to me, always seem to oversimplify the issue by suggesting absuridities like (a) we should have given Iraq more time (as the UN has for 10 years, to no appreciable avail); (b) Saddam Hussein posed little threat to the international community (ignoring that even Clinton knew this wasn't true); or worst of all (c) that the war in Iraq will encourage Islamic anti-americanism even more (as if this wouldn't have happened anyway).So as an opposer of the Iraq war, I appreciate reading books like Hitchens' that at very least gives some meaty considerations of the 'pro-Iraq-war' type. I agree with other reviewers that as the book is a short collection of short essays, Hitchens does more by way of rhetoric than analysis. I also agree that the lack of citations was a problem. But I vehemently disagree with those who feel that Hitchens does not know what he is talking about, that he simply has a 'neo-con' bias (Hitchens has always been and continues to be on the far left), or that his arguments are not eye-opening or persuasive.Hitchens focuses on two things in particular: rebutting those overly simplistic slogans of what he calls (yes, a bit unfairly) the 'peaceniks'; and ruminating on Hussein's human rights violations and the overly-bravado way he openly (arrogantly) defies UN stipulations. He even goes so far as to point out (what we all kind of thought, but tried to suppress) that an international clash with Saddam was something of an inevitability. Was it best now or later? Since Hitchens doesn't put much faith in the UN, whose known Hussein was a problem, but dragged its feat for ten years, Hitchens answers that now is better than later in dealing with Saddam.The 'peaceniks' bear much of the brunt of Hitchens' wrath. Slogans like &quot;no war for oil&quot; and &quot;But Hussein wasn't the worst of the bad guys,&quot; really get Hitchens' juice flowing. On the first, Hitchens asks us whether or not what the peaceniks are suggesting is to leave Iraq's oil resources in the hands of the self-same man who showed no hesitation in burning Kuwait's oil fields in the process of 'surrendering' them back to Kuwait? Is such a man not a huge danger to Iraq's oil fields as well? AS to whether we should treat Hussein with kids gloves simply because he is not the 'worst of the bad guys' here is Hitchens himself:&quot;Did the people who said this have any idea what they were saying? How many bad guys could they name who had violated the Genocide Convention on their own territory, invaded two neighboring states, openly financed suicide bombing, sought and nearly acquired numclear capacity and were within easy reach of 9 percent of the world's energy reserves...A man that not only murdered his mildest critics but has also murdered members of his own government...[?]&quot; [p.9]This should at very least whet people's appetite to learn more. And despite the lack of citations or extended essays, a book like this should at very least be read by the war's critics (myself included, of course) to remind them that, if anything, arguments - good arguments - can be made on all sides. Reading this book confirmed much of what I've long suspected. Yes, I am still a critic of the war, but despite what all too many people say, neither 'side' on this issue seems to have a so desperately wanted monopoly on the truth.",1

Its style shows its age: reading this book is like listening to an old 1920's newspaper reporter from the far end of the bar after he's had too many drinks: lots of exotic tall tales of life in the gritty city; countless names and places rise and disappear never to be heard again. The overall effect is entertaining but completely unbelievable, as though Paul Bunyon had moved to the Lower East Side of 19th-century Manhattan.One illustration will suffice: the early gangster &quot;Mighty Mose&quot; is describe as 'at least 8 feet tall' wearing boots studded with inch-long spikes.On one occasion Asbury has Mose pulling an oak tree out of the ground by its roots to 'smite' some of a rival gang, the Dead Rabbits. On another the author claims Mose swam underwater from Manhattan to Staten Island without coming up for air. It comes off as the kind of book a boy would have hidden in a corncrib to read when it was first published in 1927: lowlife fun, but if you're looking for the real history, you will be disappointed.You will be even FURTHER disappointed if you expect the book to resemble the new Scorcese movie in any manner. Although Scorcese borrows the names of characters from the book - Bill the Butcher, Jack Scirocco, Vallon, Everdeane - and sets the movie around the time of the 1863 Draft Riots, which really occured - in the book these characters are sometimes separated by 50 years and 100 pages. The character played by Leonardo diCaprio, Amsterdam Vallon, does not appear at all in the book.I first read the book before the movie was filmed, because of my interest in New York history. It's entertaining although the writing style is pretty archaic. But if you came to this page looking for the 'true story' behind the movie, you won't find it here.",1

Howard Hughes the Untold Story,,,,,,,,,,B000OU5QLE,,A22LX6529JJ166,K. Johnson,95/106,5.0,1049500800,The Person Behind The Name,"Hughes was a man who accomplished most of what he did before my time, so I've only remembered him as a billionaire, eccentric, and recluse, before reading this book. During his time he was a go-getter who tried many adventurous things professionally and both personally and privately.This book brings to light the details of of the younger Hughes' extraordinary personal life, which I found more interesting than the business side of it. He spent notable time in Southern California and Los Angeles. Many tales bring Old Hollywood and Los Angeles to light. His involvement in the movie business producing films, influenced in part, as an avenue to get to the ladies of the screen. Details of his relationships with the stars of the day are illuminated. Taking dates to the mounted cross atop one of the Hollywood Hills, overlooking the flatlands and lights of LA. He even crashed a plane into 3 houses in Beverly Hills.His 3rd plane crash, occurred while performing a flying stunt during the shooting of a movie (the stunt pilots refused to do the stunt because they considered it too dangerous). As a result of that crash he was in the hospital with critical life-threatening injuries. This was when HH was introduced to Codeine for the severe pain, something he would become addicted to for most of the rest of his life.The book later progresses in the latter years of Hughes. Today, it is apparent to contemporary psychologists that Hughes was likely suffering from a form of the Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. Nowadays, OCD is more understood and highly treatable with medication. In HH's time, it was not thought of in biological and physiological terms.Hughes' first break came when he entered a screening room and stayed in it for 5 full months. He didn't bathe, watched the same movies 30 times over, and survived on a diet of candy bars. Hughes consciously and voluntarily turned over his business affairs to competent managers. These were employees, and were people who made prudent decisions and looked out for HH's best interests. During this time, other sharks started to gather. Such is the case when large amounts of money is involved. Bill Gay, one of Howard's chauffeur, made crafty and cunning political moves to ascend over the years. He got Howard's ear, and became more influential on him. Gay eventually took the reigns of control over Huges' wealth. He then deftly purged the other business managers who served Hughes with dedication and integrity. The former chauffeur and his fellow Mormon henchman took over Hughes and his affairs, isolated him, and squeezed out those who cared for Hughes and wanted the best for him.It's sad, for during the latter decades of Hughes life it seemed that no one was really there for him, if he had wanted anyone to to be there.In death, over one thousand--yes, 1000--people came out of the woodwork to lay claim to Howard Hughes wealth after his passing.To this day, We're still not sure if his death was natural, self-induced, or the intentional doings of others....",1
A treatise of human nature,"Unpopular in its day, David Hume's sprawling, three-volume 'A Treatise of Human Nature' (1739-40) has withstood the test of time and had enormous impact on subsequent philosophical thought. Hume's comprehensive effort to form an observationally grounded study of human nature employs John Locke's empiric principles to construct a theory of knowledge from which to evaluate metaphysical ideas. A key to modern studies of eighteenth-century Western philosophy, the Treatise considers numerous classic philosophical issues, including causation, existence, freedom and necessity, and morality. Unabridged republication of the edition originally published by Oxford at the Clarendon Press, London, 1888.",['David Hume'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zHYO1Fh9_JMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=zHYO1Fh9_JMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=A+treatise+of+human+nature&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Courier Corporation,2003-01-01,http://books.google.com/books?id=zHYO1Fh9_JMC&dq=A+treatise+of+human+nature&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Philosophy'],13.0,B0007J6PZI,,AMB8H8QMOG95R,ctdreyer,95/106,5.0,1085529600,The Greatest Achievement of Our Greatest Philosopher,"Before he chose to diddle away his later years writing book after book of history, playing house with Rousseau, annoying the religious authorities, and forging a lasting reputation as an all-around good guy, Hume dedicated his youth to writing the this book, which is nothing less than the single greatest work of philosophy in the English language. Indeed, I don't think there are even any other close competitors for that title. Naturally, then, this work was largely ignored during Hume's lifetime.Notwithstanding the widely told, and somewhat accurate, standard story of the history of modern philosophy according to which Kant's rearguard action in response to Hume is the culmination of the modern period, I think that this book rather than Kant's First Critique is where it's at. Certainly, no book of modern philosophy compares to this complex, intricately argued, inspiring, maddening, imaginative, iconoclastic, encyclopedic tome when it comes to influence on contemporary philosophers in the Anglo-American analytic tradition. And while it's true that Kant's system is almost unparalleled in the breadth of its influence, defenders of the traditional story of modern philosophy need to remember that 'almost'. For it seems to me that, among the moderns, Hume got there first. He, and not Kant, is the first modernist whose importance is manifest in all the main areas of philosophy: epistemology (skepticism and the problem of induction), metaphysics (causation, personal identity, etc.), philosophy of mind (action theory, rationality) meta-ethics (meta-ethical subjectivism, proto-noncognitivism, reason vs. emotions, moral psychology, etc.), normative ethics (importance of benevolence, justice as an artificial virtue, etc.).Want some evidence of Hume's pervasive influence? It's not just that everyone working in this tradition has read Hume, though they have. Nor is it just that Hume's stamp is all over the concerns and positions of contemporary philosophers, though it is. Nor is it just that Hume's influence is celebrated (or bemoaned) by pretty much every philosopher you come across, though that's true as well. No, the true measure of his intellectual ascendancy is that there's a position dubbed &quot;Humean&quot; in pretty much every area of philosophy, and, depending on one's view of the topic, it's either the obviously correct view--it was Hume's position, after all!--or a pernicious heresy for which no good arguments have been provided and for which there isn't good reason to think it was even Hume's actual position. You know you've made it when both the defenders of the status quo and those who can't abide that status quo claim you as their own.Why is Hume so important? I think there are two reasons, each corresponding to one of the influential interpretations of Hume's work as a whole. The first interpretation of Hume's corpus sees it as shot through with a radical skepticism about anything and everything, and corresponding to this interpretation is a conception of Hume's importance as consisting in his occupying the place of the philosopher opponent of common sense par excellence. Hume, according to this interpretation, takes the empiricism of Locke, which in his hands looks like nothing so much as self-conscious common sense, and wields it as a weapon against more or less everything we tend to believe. That is, we should see Hume as taking up the empiricism of Locke and Berkeley and pushes it to its logical conclusion: a thoroughgoing skepticism. Think you can know there is a mind-independent world of physical objects? Think you're a single person who persists through time? Think things stand in causal relationships to one another? Think you can know whether the sun will explode tomorrow? You should think again, Hume says, and he's happy to show you why empiricism leads to this conclusion. So, if this is right, the importance of Hume's project consists in its status as a for rationalists, for non-skeptics of all stripes, and for all ordinary, right-thinking folks.Now, undoubtedly, there's some truth in the stereotypical view of Hume as the young radical who took empiricism to its implausible limits. But this isn't where his true importance lies--at least not among contemporary philosophers. What has been most influential among contemporary exponents of the Anglo-American analytic tradition is Hume's unrepentant and radical naturalism. This interpretation of his project downplays Hume's skepticism and emphasizes his professed intentions to provide a positive account of the operation of the human mind that appealed to nothing beyond the evidence of our senses. According to proponents of this interpretation, Hume is most interested in a description of the operation of the human mind. He's describing what human nature allows us to know and what it doesn't allow us to know. Here Hume's importance consists not in his providing a challenge to the views of philosophers and of the hoi polloi, but in his providing us with a model of how philosophy should be done.I feel that I've strayed somewhat from the topic of the book here, but I suppose that was inevitable. It would, of course, have been pointless to attempt to summarize Hume's arguments, or even his conclusions, in a review of this length. The only summary of this book's content that the reader needs is this: Hume discusses nearly everything of importance in philosophy, and his discussions of nearly every issue reveal an unsurpassed (and rarely equaled) level of philosophical brilliance.To whom do I recommend this book? The answer, in short, is everyone. If you're even slightly interested in philosophy, you simply can't get by without reading this. If you're at all interested in the history of ideas, you need to read this. If you're the slightest bit curious about our modern worldview and its origin, it would be a good idea for you to read this. If you're interested enough in Hume to have come across this review and read it to this point, you'll want to read this.Concerning editions of this book. I wish Amazon would separate the various editions of this book so I could review them separately, but they haven't. I'd recommend either the edition jointly edited by the Nortons and published in the Oxford Philosophical Texts series or the Selby-Bigge edition, which was for some time the standard edition of the Treatise.",1

We lived at the junction of great trout rivers in western Montana, and our father was a Presbyterian minister and a fly fisherman who tied his own flies and taught others. He told us about Christ's disciples being fishermen, and we were left to assume, as my brother and I did, that all first-class fishermen on the Sea of Galilee were fly fishermen and that John, the favorite, was a dry-fly fisherman.And, of course, after Paul's death, Norman's father urges him:Why don't you make up a story and the people to go with it? Only then will you understand what happened and why. It is those we live with and love and should know who elude us.And the story concludes:Now nearly all those I loved and did not understand when I was young are dead, but I still reach out to them.Of course, now I am too old to be much of a fisherman, and some friends think I shouldn't. Like many fly fishermen in western Montana where the summer days are almost Arctic in length, I often do not start fishing until the cool of the evening. Then in the Arctic half-light of the canyon, all existence fades to a being with my soul and memories and the sounds of the Big Blackfoot River and a four-count rhythm and the hope that fish will rise.Eventually, all things merge into one, and a river runs through it. The river was cut by the world's great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time. On some of the rocks are timeless raindrops. Under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs.I am haunted by waters.And in between these memorable passages, MacLean unfolds a timeless story of fathers and sons and brothers and their often futile attempts to understand one another and the way in which sport can provide a tie, sometimes the only tie, between them.

The premise -- that, with the turn of each page, the reader brings self-described &quot;lovable, furry Grover&quot; closer to danger at the hands of the title monster -- allows one to question the very nature of free will and destiny. Is Grover doomed to encounter the monster? The conceit that it is the act of turning pages -- the literal act of reading itself -- that causes the ending to come about inevitably leads to the question: Would the book end differently if one _didn't_ finish reading it? On another level, TMATEOTB addresses one of the paradoxes of contemporary physics: The equality of space and time. The &quot;end of the book&quot; is an event in the future, but the monster is not spoken of as &quot;arriving&quot;, but as _already being there_. Thus, turning pages moves the reader and Grover not only forward in time, as in most traditional literature, but also forward in space, leading to the perilous End of the Book. Lastly, TMATEOTB is about how we are ultimately at the whim of the cosmic forces that shape our lives. The hapless protagonist tries again and again to stop the reader from turning pages by erecting brick walls and nailing one page to the other. His efforts are futile, but he remains unaware of his essential helplessness in the face of a Reader. Perhaps, the book says, we are ultimately doomed to fail, trapped within the pages of cosmic irony, but unable to prevent or even perceive the inevitability of our encounter with the monster. The shocking twist ending wraps up the disparate threads of the text, presenting issues of self-knowledge, the nature of fear, and the question of what it truly means to be a monster. Perhaps the failure of our quests for safety in an uncertain world isn't so bad, it argues, if it leads to a confrontation like the one depicted in _The Monster At The End Of This Book_.",1
The Literary Enneagram: Characters from the Inside Out,,,,,,,,,,155552107X,18.93,A3K344XU9CKU3R,Anne Silver,95/105,5.0,999648000,Great Literature and Enneagram made Easy!,"I have two bones to pick with most Enneagram books, training programs and articles, and it&#8217;s the same trouble I have with most poetry and fiction. The first bone is that they try to rouse me from my complacency chair by describing a type instead of showing them. I don&#8217;t budge, for the most part, because I don&#8217;t often care what others are said to be, when I have no context in which to put them.They want to explore what is felt without letting me get involved. For instance, all Enneagram books say that a Seven will make boring things less boring, and Sevens have a propensity for multi-tasking. All panels of Sevens say the same and that Sevens don&#8217;t finish what they start. Yawn, this Seven, who finishes every single thing I start, says. Not one describes a scene of a garage lit by one light at pre-dawn with me doing the rumba as I trod the treadmill listening to a Gypsy Kings CD as I practice flamenco hand movements. So when I read Bridget Jones&#8217;s Diary describing my Seven personality in The Literary Enneagram I discover that perhaps my own relentless pursuit of activity is indeed a way to allay my anxieties. And my fear of missing out on things keeps me from fully enjoying the fun as I have it.Searle digs deepest to find the accurate Seven, getting me involved with perceptive and contextual introductions. The title of the book did intimidate me. I missed out on having great literature forced into my education, if you can call what I had an education. I have tried to make up for the gaps by trying to tackle Hardy, Shakespeare and D.H. Lawrence on my own so I won&#8217;t be such an .... I&#8217;m happy to report that after reading the first chapter, I understood Les Miserables without a hitch and even understood the inner critic of old Javert without referring to any Cliff Note.The second bone I have with most fiction and poetry, Enneagram books is that there&#8217;s hardly any fun involved. No pizzazz, sensuality, hot fudge sundaes. Why do I have to know about all that pain? Some of it is okay, but hey! I just don&#8217;t buy into the approach that for full understanding to take place, I must suffer. So I&#8217;m happy that Searle includes fun and sexy examples of exploring the psyche.As in &#8220;The Taming of the Shrew&#8221; where a Six, Kate is tamed by an Eight, Petruchio. Following the arrows of stress and comfort, Katharina was forced to let appearances (type three) be damned, be publically humiliated (a 6's worst fear) in order to merge (the nine position) with her husband and find peace for her troubled and belligerent station (six). Petruchio&#8217;s arc, i.e. transformation of character, is seen as his desires to get a rich wife (typical low-down eight behavior) uses an irritating know-it-all obnoxiousness (five stress point activated), but he gets his heart opened in the process, (the eight&#8217;s heart opens at the two) He actually falls in love with Katharina.This may sound complicated, as I refer to Enneagram numbers the way an astrologer refers to asteroids and quincunxes. But reading the first chapter is to have the basics under one&#8217;s belt. There&#8217;s history reaching back to Pythagorus, description of the nine types, concepts of wings, the Hornevian Triads, Stress and Security Points, and much more.The setting of literary examples is a concept someone had to develop, and I&#8217;m glad it was Judith Searle, because her compassion for people&#8217;s struggles is so wonderful. It could have easily been a book that showed characters&#8217; hateful sides, which lends itself to richer adverbs and adjectives. Throughout the book, the reader is simply placed in a character&#8217;s world through their hearts and through their challenges.Finding literary examples to describe one&#8217;s own type would be enough. But to proceed to the other types is to find gold. I had the enthralling discovery that Shakespeare is as accessible as Gary Larson&#8217;s &#8220;The Far Side.&#8221; But seriously, when we speak of Enneagram types in these dramatic ways, ways that reveal the inner dialogue, we speak of healing, cleaning up the past and loving those whom we once feared.Authors who could have had no exposure to the Enneagram, &#8220;validate the system.&#8221; The intricacy of one personality type expressed in one great piece of literature would be coincidence, but Searle brings up dozens of books where the characters follow not only their own number&#8217;s path, but bring in the side number, expresses stress points and one of the three different subtypes. The Literary Enneagram is elegant in its delivery of humanity.Searle does for the Enneagram what, dare I say, Dr. Frankenstein did for the monster. Not that animating dead body parts is my point - she just enlivens them. There is no end to studying Enneagram with this approach. To see the shadow monster in a character who has our Enneagram DNA is thorough and satisfying. To see Dr. Frankenstein&#8217;s bully (8) and know that his heart point is the Nurturer (2), then that scene where he nestles a kitten is not far-fetched.We are allowed to enter the mystery of each point through the heart of the characters Searle selects. Freed from having to learn about the types by being told about them, we enter through their fears, self-esteem and anger. We&#8217;re talking lower chakras - the way we humans express ourselves in this lifetime on earth.The set-ups are compassionate, as in democratic, &#8220;to suffer with&#8221; compassion. We enter through the heart of each literary stranger with empathy. We understand them, and in turn understand and love ourselves. As we develop Ennea-eyes, our awareness, perception and of the fragile and X-rayed character becomes closer. To read this book was to have my heart opened, broken and remain open still.",1

The premise -- that, with the turn of each page, the reader brings self-described &quot;lovable, furry Grover&quot; closer to danger at the hands of the title monster -- allows one to question the very nature of free will and destiny. Is Grover doomed to encounter the monster? The conceit that it is the act of turning pages -- the literal act of reading itself -- that causes the ending to come about inevitably leads to the question: Would the book end differently if one _didn't_ finish reading it? On another level, TMATEOTB addresses one of the paradoxes of contemporary physics: The equality of space and time. The &quot;end of the book&quot; is an event in the future, but the monster is not spoken of as &quot;arriving&quot;, but as _already being there_. Thus, turning pages moves the reader and Grover not only forward in time, as in most traditional literature, but also forward in space, leading to the perilous End of the Book.

For me, the authors answered many of those &quot;stupid&quot; questions I was too embarassed to ask even my girlfriends because I thought everyone knew the answer but me, and I didn't want to seem naive.I liked the easy question-and-answer format and simply skipped over questions I wasn't interested in at the time or to which I already knew the answer. Personally, when doctors and nurses all too often don't take the time to thoroughly explain medical issues to their patients, I really appreciated the fact that this book covered even the most commonplace issues that first-timers like myself didn't know and often didn't think to ask during a doctor visit.I may not refer to it as much during my second pregnancy, but I found &quot;WTEWYE&quot; invaluable during my first!",1

Cloyce Smith,95/104,3.0,1061596800,"More an ""epilogue"" than a fourth book in this classic series","Having read and loved the first three books in the Ender series, there was no way I was going to miss this entry. Like so many others, though, I am of split mind about the finale (and how appropriate, given the schizophrenic existence of its lead characters Ender-Peter and Val-Jane). While ""Children of the Mind"" does contain Card's trademark wit and while the last 100 pages kick into high gear, the final installment, on its own, is as unsatisfying as it is pleasing.One of the major problems is Card's ill-considered decision to publish ""Xenocide"" and ""Children of the Mind"" as two books rather than one cohesive unit; the fourth entry seems more an epilogue to the series--a 350-page denouement--than the climax it should have been. Card admits he originally planned the two books as one work, and this admission resonates like an apology. Well over a third of ""Children of the Mind"" summarizes what happened in previous volumes, and another third is riddled with endless conversations on political and metaphysical topics, many of which the characters already debated at length in ""Xenocide."" Only in the last 100 pages does Card finally abandon the themes that were presented more thoroughly (and competently) in the earlier books and turn his attention to resolving the many loose ends. In sum, Card would have been much wiser to have written a unified 600-page book rather than 900 needlessly repetitive pages.The second problem is that Card's philosophical ruminations often steer awfully close to quasi-religious mumbo-jumbo. The entire section set on Pacifica, a planet governed by Samoans, feels particularly incongruous. (Peter and Wang-mu wonder aloud--twice--what they are doing on this particular world, a question that is never really fully addressed.) True--some of the philosophical questions are fascinating, but there's very little that wasn't already said better and more succinctly in ""Xenocide,"" and the dialogue is often excruciatingly shallow. Take this conversation between Valentine and Novinha, which reads in part:""You didn't really need him anymore."" ""He never needed me."" ""He needed you desperately,"" said Valentine. ""He needed you so much he gave up Jane for you."" ""No,"" said Novinha, ""He needed my need for him. He needed to feel like he was providing for me, protecting me."" ""But you don't need his providence or his protection anymore.""I wish I could tell you this bit of dizzying dialogue is an exception, but there are similar angst-ridden conversations between Miro and Val, Peter and Wang-mu--in short, between any two characters who feel the need to explain to each other their raison d'etre. In the earlier books, Card allowed metaphysical questions to arise as much from the actions of the characters and the development of the plot as from the dialogue; in ""Children of the Mind,"" everyone seems to be in post-Freudian interplanetary counseling.Yet the book is not a wholesale disaster; and I particularly enjoyed the page-turning final resolution, even though it relies on a melodramatic sleight of hand. If the last third of ""Children of the Mind"" were merged with a pared-down version of ""Xenocide,"" the whole would probably have been equal to the excellence of the first two books in the Ender series.",1
Silently Seduced: When Parents Make their Children Partners - Understanding Covert Incest,"When a parent singles out a child for special privileges and attention, that child is often unaware that the relationship is unhealthyeven incestuous. As adults, these children struggle to feel validated, because while they have not been directly abused, they feel a sense of violation and crossed boundariesusually done in the name of 'love' and 'caring.' The parent's love feels more confining than freeing, more demanding than giving, more intrusive than nurturing. Yet these children suffer from what psychologist Kenneth Adams calls The Silent Seductionbecause there is nothing loving or caring about a close parent-child relationship that services the needs of the parent rather than the child.",['Kenneth Adams'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4IqjAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=4IqjAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Silently+Seduced:+When+Parents+Make+their+Children+Partners+-+Understanding+Covert+Incest&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,"Health Communications, Inc.",2011-09,http://books.google.com/books?id=4IqjAgAAQBAJ&dq=Silently+Seduced:+When+Parents+Make+their+Children+Partners+-+Understanding+Covert+Incest&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Family & Relationships'],3.0,1558741313,,ATFKKFZX1E2R7,"MM ""M""",95/104,5.0,1133049600,a clear guideline,"Wow, very impressive! I read it from cover to cover, in one sitting. Just could not put it down. It is written in a clear and concise manner. Almost every word seems well selected and carefully considered to support the theme of the whole book. Very convincing with powerful logic.I have to admit when I was hesitant to order this book at the beginning. I thought, ""What this says about me, if I need to read a book on this topic?"" I felt uncomfortable to put myself in the category of covert incest victim.Several things which are happening in my life, made me decide to take a try. My career has experienced a setback for several years. I have difficulty in establishing a great long term relationship. And most immediately, I have dreams of being angry at my parents. Those dreams rarely occur, but when they do, once or twice a year, I find my whole body tighten up in anger when I wake up. I ask myself, if I can be so angry about something I don't understand, why not spend some time to understand what exactly makes me so angry?When the book arrived, I wrapped it up in a book cover to hide the name. I have to agree this is an uncomfortable topic and I do not want to be seen reading such a book in public.But let me tell you, this is one of the most important books I have read in years. It is neatly organized:First two chapters:-What is the silent seduction?-When is a child betrayed by a parent's love?Introduce the concept of silent seduction and general pattern.The next two chapters:-The man of the house-Daddy's little girlTalk about the specific situations in case of a mother and a son, and a father and a daughter. The author uses different cases to address different areas. It is quite specific.The following chapters:-When does sex become a hiding place?Discusses the impact on the victim's sexual feelings when the victim grows up.-The struggle to CommitTalk about the impact on relationships the victim will face as an adultThe last chapter:-Towards WholenessA short but comforting guide towards healing.When I was reading the first two chapters, I found myself nodding occasionally but suspicious. But when it got specific, my eyes grew wide, as I saw a step by step description of my life. It is as if the author had followed my life and summed it up in different cases. It is scary to see your life being so accurately depicted.As it was very late (midnight), I went to sleep. And I was sad. The author reminds in the last chapter that when we let it go, we would feel sadness.I turned back and forth on bed, feeling emptiness. The kind of emptiness you feel when you cannot find the purpose in life.The book made a very important point, that when we were treated as special by our parents, often it is perceived as love from our parents, and we hang on to it as the only and most powerful love we have experienced, but actually it is not love, it is an expression of needs of our parents. We were there merely to satisfy the emotional needs of our parents. And our needs, when as little kids, were ignored.Logically, I accepted this point. But emotionally, it was sad to recognize the single most powerful love in our life experience was not even love. It brought a question: what do we live for?Since I could not sleep, I got up and started reading again.The next chapter talks about sex addicts. I almost laughed, hey, this could not be about me. Out of curiosity, I did not skip it entirely. Wow, when my finger touched on the last page of this chapter, it turned out it was talking about me. It talks about the seeking of sexual highs, and the seductive patterns.It exactly describes the experience I have been having in the last year. I reveled in the attention of many suitors. I seduced one after another. Of course, the seduction was very subtle. I behaved exactly like a lady, but secretly put the man of my seduction in anxiety to get me. It was like a power game. And I felt safe when powerful men fell for me. And I do not stay for any long term relationship. I just seduced and moved on. The reason why I never labeled myself as sex addict, was because actual sex seldom happened. The seduction was very sexually charged (with strong sexual energy), but I almost always moved on before the man could actually get me on bed.I did not realize this was what I was doing until I read this book. I just did it unconsciously. For me, it was a game of fun and power to get back at men, and to make myself feel safe, treasured, chased and desirable. Upon this chapter, I began to realize, maybe, just maybe, it is the start of sexual and love addiction.The chapter also talks about double life. It did make me laugh, because in my fantasy of success, I always added on a second life of sexual satisfaction. It is my ideal life to be a highly successful woman, with a colorful secret sex life. The thrill of having a secret dirty life against common convention seems so exciting and satisfying, against the background of success and social recognition.This chapter makes me rethink my goal. Is my goal of success, really something I want, or is it a way to get back at my past so that I do not need to face my past? Is that a way to prove to my parents I grow up to be better than them, beyond their wildest expectations? Is this a way to prove myself I was not hurt by my parents, I grow over and above the hurtful past?My career is in a setback for several years now. It happened very unexpectedly. When everyone expected me to become a great career woman, suddenly all motivation drained away from me. For several years, I just sat around, wanting to do nothing. In business meetings, though I knew I probably were the most qualified in giving out professional opinions (due to my qualification and educational background), I sat in a corner, demure and obscure. I do not understand why I hate to go out, getting what I deserve, and what the other people think I deserve. It is like I clipped my own wings intentionally.It came to a point that I took a look at my past. I had been a wonder kid academically. I found whenever my academic future or career future opened up to a new height, somehow, on several important occasions, I just escaped the night (or months) before it happened. I undid the effort I put in for years, to avoid collecting the fruit of being much more successful than others.Every time I did that, it was extremely painful for me afterwards. Guilt and confusion took over. It took years to build the base for success, and it took years to recover from the disappointment of escaping from success and make a comeback. It was like a cycle. Maybe it finally got to my spirit, and I started to associate the prospect of success, with the slow and deep pains from disappointment and fear of escaping again. So, in the end, I felt chasing success did not worth it any more.In Ken Adams's book, it discusses the ambivalence of commitment to relationships. It is an extremely interesting chapter. From my personal point of view, I do see my own relationship surfacing from the pages, a quick commitment, an illusion of starting anew, followed by a slow stew of doubt, and the desire to get out.I do wish this wonderful enlightening chapter could address more issues: not only commitment to relationships, but also commitment to goals and personal ambitions. Does the fear of abandonment drive us away not only from committing to intimacy, but also to allowing ourselves the success we deserve, work hard for, and deny ourselves for?When it comes to the last chapter, it is comforting to see we are not hopeless. It talks about letting go of your idealized image of the seductive parent. Among the many thing I learn from reading this book, this is probably the most important. To realize what you cherish as the best love and the integral part of your childhood memory and what makes who you are today, is actually an unconscious seduction by your parent to realize his or her own need in an unhappy relationship. It is not about you, and never about you. And you miss the important development phase of recognizing your own needs, building your own character, wants and values as a human being. Chasing your parent's love is like chasing emptiness, something they never can give, and something which does not exist. The lack of it makes a strong emptiness in your heart, since you never learn how to live for yourself. That phase of development was stolen from you, by the need of your parents.Naturally it is angry to recognize it. It feels like being betrayed by someone so close to your heart. I now partly understand why my dreams were so intense, where I screamed at my parents for their lack of love and their insistency of not seeing the error where it is. (In real life, I never accused my parents. I just cannot.)The book talks about acknowledging your anger toward the seductive parent. And I agree it is very necessary. We need to see the reality the way it is, before we can come back to reality and come to terms with ourselves.Is it necessary to make your parents acknowledge your anger and their grand mistake? From my experience, it is a no. Because they most likely will never acknowledge their mistake, and it will become a contest of wills. My grandmother was seriously abusive, (hehe, now I agree family issues pass from generation to generation), and my father was deeply hurt. But until her death, my Grandma never ever admitted her mistake, no matter how miserable she made her children's lives. It is unfortunate in an effort to be a better parent, my father turned out to be very much like my Grandma, even though in different ways. From my lesson, it is largely useless to confront your parents, making them admit their mistakes, since they will never ever able to see themselves in that light. They pride themselves as the best, most righteous people in the neighborhood. While that blind pride probably will make you very angry, because you know how much dirt is wiped under the family carpet, they live for that image.But it is necessary to speak your voice, and set boundaries. (The book talks about: If your seductive parent is alive, begin to set boundaries and separate.) If you see something seriously wrong in your family, speak out.During my brief visit to the parents' home the last time, my father consistently verbally abused my mom before me, saying she was stupid, short-sighted, silly woman, never can do a thing right, blah, blah. I finally could not take it any more and I confronted him alone while my mother was away.He was so angry that I dared to speak like that to him. He screamed how badly he had been treated for years by my mom. I simply said, there is no way to treat even a stranger, the way you treat mom. No matter how bad she is, at least respect her as a human being in your words. Give her the respect she deserves as a person. And I stuck to this basic point. I did not argue what was right or wrong in their marriage, since that was beyond my ability to argue. My father nearly kicked me out of the home. (Hey, it is important to be economically independent, so when you are kicked out, you have a place to go).In a few days, when I made the second visit back home, he calmed down and even respected me a little bit. Later, my mother told me he changed a little bit to become more accommodating. I do not know whether my confrontation ever worked, but it is rare to see a man like my father change even a little bit.My experience is, even though I do not have guts to confront my parents directly about my childhood, start to set boundaries and address the family issues in simple, objective terms. Never take side and never be involved in a family political war, because there is no win for you. But address the serious and persistent wrongs happening in your family, in a simple, firm, objective view, to make the person who is aggressor realize it is wrong, and to make the person who is victim realize he or she is being wronged. Set an example of being assertive, and encourage each family member to stand up for him/herself and take responsibility in his/her life. Compassion is a good thing, but compassion can be misplaced and taken advantaged of.The last chapter, the healing and the change, is in my view, one of the sweetest things to read in this book. It makes me stay hopeful and think of how to have a plan to address the issues. So, it is no surprise I wish this chapter can be longer, and more specific in how to set boundary and how to address the anger invariably arising when dealing with the pains.Throughout the review, I repeatedly stress how close the cases in the book resembled my own life. And it surprised me a great deal to read the preface and find out the cases were not real life cases, but structured from the author's clinical practice.Nonetheless, I agree the cases are very close to reality. It happened some of my close friends have serious problems with their families too.A guy took to drinking to drown his frustration in dealing with his parents. His story was very similar to the cases in the book. Unfortunately, his anger was not recognized by any of his family members. Coming from a very traditional family background, every family member encouraged him to acquiesce to his parents no matter what. (It is valued as great family ethics to respect your parents, no matter what; and give them whatever they want, to feel like a good deserving child.) And it was exactly what I told him too when he came for my help. I said, ""After all, it is your parents. Do you want them to feel unhappy as old man and woman?"" In my words, I denied his right to be angry, just because he was the child and he had a duty to make his parents happy, especially since his parents were aging. It was several years ago. I wish I had read this book when he came for my help.He was not the only friend who has this issue. I am certain there are many people out there who experienced similar issues. It is just that this is not supposed to be talked about among friends, or in public. My book cover is still shielding the book title, and you see, I do not want to use my real name in the review.But, do yourself a favor. Buy and read this book, if you relate yourself to issues like this, or if you are like me, feeling angry and frustrated about yourself without knowing why.

Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and Its Consequences (Vintage),,,,,,,,,,0679726012,,A26KSBC3315A3O,Nadyne Richmond,95/104,3.0,1078704000,"interesting book, but lacking focus","The problem that resulted in this book is far-reaching: the public simply doesn't understand mathematics. Statistics, ranging from a 10%-off sale to the sort found in opinion polls, are unfathomable to the general populace. Probability, especially in the context of gambling, is understood by only a scant handful of people. The list of misunderstood mathematics is nearly endless.In the first few chapters of the book, Paulos describes various issues that the innumerate (that is, those who don't understand numbers and math) often have issues understanding. He describes the issue to a reasonable level of detail, then derives answers for them. Don't let the use of the word 'derive' scare you off: the answers are readable and readily understandable to a general audience. In some cases, if you're really rusty, you might need to read them a second time to grasp the solution.Later chapters, however, are not written for the innumerate. They are attempts to convince the reader that mathematical education needs to be improved. I think that everyone agrees that education should be improved, but he offers suggestions that are impractical or nonsensical.Ultimately, the problem of this book is a lack of focus. Paulos could have written either a book that tackles basic mathematical issues that the general public doesn't understand, or he could have written a book that describes the consequences of innumeracy. He tried to do both, and stuffed both topics into a single slim volume. In doing so, he shortchanges both audiences. The result is a book that is good, but does not fully address the needs of anyone.If you find yourself uncomfortable with mathematics, pick up a copy of this book and read up to chapter five. If you are comfortable with mathematics and are looking for fodder to prove the point that improving mathematical knowledge at any level is productive, this book will not serve your purpose.",1

Everything that happens to Hathcock seems like something out of a movie; something no mortal man could survive. I learned to respect the discipline and will-power of a well-trained Marine, and was left in awe of the effectiveness of the sniper. Charles Henderson does his part, too. He not only tells Hathcock's incredible story, but makes it an immersive, addictive one to read. Through his clear and descriptive writing, the reader is transported back in time to the dark &quot;Charlie&quot;-filled jungles of Vietnam, where he lies beside the sniper known as &quot;Long Tra'ng&quot; and experiences not only the satisfaction of a well-placed shot, but also the emotional struggles that a man must deal with when he takes the life of another one.

The Natural Soap Book: Making Herbal and Vegetable-Based Soaps,"The definitive resource for making vegetable-based soaps from scratch, from buying supplies to cutting the final bars.",['Susan Miller Cavitch'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=k2TStNMjupkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=k2TStNMjupkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Natural+Soap+Book:+Making+Herbal+and+Vegetable-Based+Soaps&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Storey Publishing,1995-01-01,http://books.google.com/books?id=k2TStNMjupkC&dq=The+Natural+Soap+Book:+Making+Herbal+and+Vegetable-Based+Soaps&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Crafts & Hobbies'],2.0,0882668889,10.17,A1Y6YHIK743VEM,P. S. Black,95/103,3.0,957830400,Not just the same ol' thing.,"I really enjoy the straight forward writing style of Ms. Cavitch. She speaks to you like you're having a conversation with a good friend.In the Introduction she gives some basic chemistry of soap lessons which are very easy for the non chemist to understand. Then she goes on to explain different types of soap, different fats and oils what when you might want to use each. All through the beginning are charming, little stories about real soap makers and their businesses. What a nice touch.This seems to be a very well thought out book with just oodles of information on just about every aspect of making soap. She's even included a small section on blending essential oils and give some suggested blending for certain scents.The coloring section isn't as lengthy as I think it could be, but it is a good start for the beginner, especially for those who want to start using herbs for coloring soaps.I can't say I agree with Ms. Cavitch on her temperatures explanation. But that does seem to be more of a preference thing. She feels that vegetable soaps made over 95 degrees F are problematic, but I have never found that to be the case. Actually... I have found the opposite to be true.Weighing your essential oils in advance as she suggests you do in Step 1, is going to give you a problem unless you tightly seal it. I learned right away that they will evaporate into the air. What you weighed out before you started stirring will be partly gone by the time you use it! She does however, later in another section, mention that you should tightly seal the container.A picture, an actual photograph, of what 'trace' means would be nice. Would it kill these authors to say something like, &quot;thick like pudding&quot;? No one can ever figure out what is meant by the word trace. Newbees sort of freak out about it, and I can understand that.There is one thing that I really don't like about her recipes. That is, some of the items are in pounds and some of the items are in grams. Unless you're good at converting or your scale does both, you're going to have a problem. It would have been much nicer had she offered all items in both grams and ounces and then you could use what you use. I can see why she's doing it. Grams offer much better accuracy with those items like lye and grapefruit seed extract. But many who aren't interested in doing conversions, won't use the recipes. :(Cavitch is working with that old, bothersome method of matching your lye solution temp with your oil temp at about 80 degrees F. I don't recommend this method as it causing a soap separation many times when the temp drops and saponification slows to a crawl. But a good many people still use this method.Her suggestions that a mostly olive oil soap can trace in about 7 minutes I don't agree with at all. I have hand stirred more like 3 hours for mostly olive soap. I wouldn't want anyone to think that they can actually accomplish this and not have under stirred soap. Pomace (a lower grade of olive) will trace quickly, but I don't think that can be done in less than 1/2 hour with hand stirring.I guess the really big problem people have with Susan Cavitch is her method of figuring lye. What she does works, however, soap makers don't 'discount' lye, they add more fats/oils. It is quite confusing if you talk to someone who figures things with her discount method. It is just one of those annoying things. Some say the glass is half full, others half empty. Well, for Cavitch alone, the glass is half empty.There are many recipes in this book and also a section on things you can add to the recipes and how to add them, such as herbs, superfat oils, etc., to make some varied soaps. There is a chapter on suggestions on wrapping soaps decoratively which is fun too.All in all, I think this is a high quality book. I think the actual method of making soap is outdated now, but aren't they all? We have finally gone beyond the Ann Bramson book, but the authors have not caught up yet.I have my little pet peeves about the book, but I think everyone should have a copy. All that chemistry is good to have so that you can talk to Dr. Bob later and actually understand him! :) . . .",1
"Sex & the Perfect Lover: Tao, Tantra & the Kama Sutra","Go beyond the headlines and the hype to get the newest findings in the burgeoning field of gender studies. Drawing on disciplines that include evolutionary science, anthropology, animal behavior, neuroscience, psychology, and endocrinology, Deborah Blum explores matters ranging from the link between immunology and sex to male/female gossip styles. The results are intriguing, startling, and often very amusing. For instance, did you know that. . . • Male testosterone levels drop in happy marriages; scientists speculate that women may use monogamy to control male behavior • Young female children who are in day-care are apt to be more secure than those kept at home; young male children less so • Anthropologists classify Western societies as ""mildly polygamous"" The Los Angeles Times has called Sex on the Brain ""superbly crafted science writing, graced by unusual compassion, wit, and intelligence, that forms an important addition to the literature of gender studies.""",['Deborah Blum'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AO17FzzmTl8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=AO17FzzmTl8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sex&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin,1998-07-01,http://books.google.com/books?id=AO17FzzmTl8C&dq=Sex&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Social Science'],1.0,0738704083,,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,"Jenny J.J.I.

As a loner person, I have always had trouble with my wife in terms of our relationship. She keeps saying that I don't love her because I don't ""show it"" by talking with her more, or spending more time with her. I do love her very much but it grates on her the way I am. If the act of talking is her measure of love, I have little chance. However, our family is great with great kids and all you'd ever want.

What the wife and many people of the world must know is - we relish the time we have alone. We don't need to call a friend the moment that another friend leaves. Nor do we need constant human interation to be ""happy"". We don't hate social people or their actions. We just feel that much of it is ""inconsequential"". Introspectively, I am happy with myself - yet she questions my happiness and our love.

The French Lieutenant's Woman (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition),,,,,,,,,,0613172426,,A6FIAB28IS79,Samuel Chell,95/103,5.0,1053907200,Living in the Moment,"This novel is at once a retrospective and a prospective, a narrative that ultimately erases the temporal boundaries between the Victorian era and the modern reader's present moment. Fowles goes considerably beyond a novelist such as A. S. Byatt and even most historians in painting the portrait of an era and its citizens as well as evoking the multifarious ""Victorian sensibility,"" with its ambivalence about social class, morality, progress, science, religion, and, of course, sex.The affair between Charles Smithson, amateur gentleman paleontologist, and Sarah Woodruff, alluring, forbidden ""outcast,"" is, in many respects, no more than a ruse (readers who express disappointment at the ending have no doubt swallowed too much of the bait, reading the novel as conventional romance). The epigraph to the final chapter, Matthew Arnold's ""True Piety Is Acting What One Knows,"" can be taken as a key to the story's compelling theme and purpose. The narrative is a variation on the quest pattern, with the salvation of the story's everyman-protagonist at stake. Moreover, his progress from ignorance to self-knowledge, contrary to Marxist theory and, for that matter, inexorable Darwinian laws of natural selection, requires that he separate himself from his ""age,"" the very culture that has formed him, defined him, and threatens to deform him.The climax in the story is not Charles' meeting with Sarah in the home of the Rossetti's but his epiphany, in Chapter 48, while viewing a Crucifix in the sanctuary of a church. At this moment he sees his preoccupation with fossils as representative of his society's fixation on custom, externals, and respectability at the expense of the interior self and its own priorities. Charles and Sarah find their heart's bliss ""through"" but certainly not ""with"" each other.I read this novel at the same time I was reading ""The English Patient,"" Michael Ondaatje's poetic novel that challenges spatial boundaries much as Fowles' narrative does the same with temporal ones. Ondaatje takes fewer chances, constructing a fantastic, impressionistic narrative that makes very few mistakes and admittedly casts a lingering spell. Fowles', on the other hand, risks a lot, especially with his frequent, self-referential intrusions into the narrative--potentially alienating some readers, whether on grounds that he's violated the implict author-reader contract or that he's naively ""postmodernist."" Regardless, Fowles' novel is the richer, greater achievement, and ultimately the less contrived and pretentious as well.""The French Lieutenant's Woman"" is capable of satisfying at many levels. It offers a comprehensive history of the Victorian era, a Dickensian gallery of characters, an dramatization of the faith-doubt struggle found in the poetry of Tennyson and Arnold, a critique of Victorian and modern cultural malaise, a postmodernist literary conceit, an archetypal journey with an existentialist twist. Above all, the attentive reader of this allusive, multi-layered, yet remarkably focused story will be rewarded with a unique understanding of narrative and the reader's place within it. The narrator's offering the reader a choice between two endings has the effect of ""liberating"" the narrative and relating it to the examined life of the reader's own present.It's difficult to see how a triumph such as this could be excluded from any short list of greatest novels written in English during the second half of the twentieth century.",1

For example, Torn tells a story about being required to smoke cigarettes rather than cigars in a particular role.

Torn felt that both his art and his intelligence, as well as that of the audience, were sold out by this demand.Far from being &quot;badly dated,&quot; Terkel's critique is monstrously accurate today.

Since its debut in 1990, The Wheel of Time® by Robert Jordan has captivated millions of readers around the globe with its scope, originality, and compelling characters. The Wheel of Time turns and Ages come and go, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth returns again. In the Third Age, an Age of Prophecy, the World and Time themselves hang in the balance. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow. Fleeing from Ebou Dar with the kidnapped Daughter of the Nine Moons, whom he is fated to marry, Mat Cauthon learns that he can neither keep her nor let her go, not in safety for either of them, for both the Shadow and the might of the Seanchan Empire are in deadly pursuit. Perrin Aybara seeks to free his wife, Faile, a captive of the Shaido, but his only hope may be an alliance with the enemy. Can he remain true to his friend Rand and to himself? For his love of Faile, Perrin is willing to sell his soul. At Tar Valon, Egwene al'Vere, the young Amyrlin of the rebel Aes Sedai, lays siege to the heart of Aes Sedai power, but she must win quickly, with as little bloodshed as possible, for unless the Aes Sedai are reunited, only the male Asha'man will remain to defend the world against the Dark One, and nothing can hold the Asha'man themselves back from total power except the Aes Sedai and a unified White Tower. In Andor, Elayne Trakland fights for the Lion Throne that is hers by right, but enemies and Darkfriends surround her, plotting her destruction. If she fails, Andor may fall to the Shadow, and the Dragon Reborn with it. Rand al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn himself, has cleansed the Dark One's taint from the male half of the True Source, and everything has changed. Yet nothing has, for only men who can channel believe that saidin is clean again, and a man who can channel is still hated and feared-even one prophesied to save the world.

Mr Jordan, tell us about your latest novel.RJ: This is Book 22 of the Wheel of Time series, Rand Clips his Toenails .ED: The book has come in from some criticism from the fans on the forums.RJ: I can't imagine why.ED: Perhaps because the entire book is devoted entirely to a description of Rand clipping his toenails.RJ: I felt that there were a lot of important plot points addressed in the book.ED It's seven hundred pages about toenail clipping!RJ: I think you are failing to understand the significance of the toenail clipping act. Each toenail must be clipped in the precise order as laid out in The Prophecies of The Dragon. The manner in which each toenail is clipped is subtly different, with serious implications for all of the other characters.ED: What possible implications could there be for the other characters?

For many, that includes designing and building the homes themselves. But building a home is a complex project filled with pitfalls and traps, and unwary budding homeowners can find their dreams turning into nightmares.Enter Mark Smith, who has built several houses of his own. Written by a man who acted as his own general contractor, &quot;The Owner-Builder Book&quot; is crammed with useful advice on how to oversee your own project, from planning to construction. But be warned: it's unflinchingly honest about the amount of work and stress involved. While Mark Smith writes that it's possible to build a house in six months, first will come at least a year of planning and organizing. Once construction begins, you'll have to deal with ensuring that subcontractors appear on time and finish their work on time before the next group of workers appears. You may also have to deal with problems such as late deliveries of materials, subcontractors who don't show up, or who demand advances before working, threatened lawsuits,Reading this book will give you a better appreciation of what the general contractor goes through. It will either fire your desire to run the show yourself and pocket the savings, or gratefully turn over the work to someone who does it for a living. But what it will also do is give you the information needed to make informed decisions that, even if you work with a contractor, will save you money.",1

So Anyway I own the Ultimate Bowflex. I used to own the regular Bowflex with no attachments and I really never used it. It just sat for a very long time. Alot of it was I just wasn't sure how to do the exercises. So I went on a low carb diet, started walking and lost weight. Then I hit a HUGE stall. I always new I needed to strength train but never did. I hated going to the gym and wasted my money on a year membership. So this past winter I got an offer to send back the regular bowflex, trade it in, get 1000 toward an ultimate with EVERYTHING. So I did it. Get a brand new machine with all the bells and whistles. Again I still wasnt sure what to do. THe video that comes with the ultimate is great, gives a good description of what to do. So I was looking around one day and saw this book and brought it. Well I love it. It is great. Gives GREAT detail instructions and tips for the best exercises on the bowflex. It also has several plans, for gaining muscle, losing fat, for your hips, for your arms, for your chest and for your abs. I still need to lose fat before I can try other routines. But I went on his meal plan which is real simple and good for you. I am eating stuff that was restricted on a low carb diet. And I lost weight. I used to not be able to go down past 168 no matter what I did. Now I am 5'11&quot; and 162 lbs (which is actually just right I just need to lose fat and gain muscle). Also if I cheat I don't balloon up. I highly recommend this book if you have the bowflex. His workout routines and eating plans are also worth it. There is also background information on the bowflex and he also explains healthy information (such as increasing water intake and the like). Ellington Darden knows his stuff and I want to read his other books. Take care.",1
The Long Loneliness: The Autobiography of Dorothy Day,"The compelling autobiography of a remarkable Catholic woman, sainted by many, who championed the rights of the poor in America’s inner cities. When Dorothy Day died in 1980, the New York Times eulogized her as “a nonviolent social radical of luminous personality . . . founder of the Catholic Worker Movement and leader for more than fifty years in numerous battles of social justice.” Here, in her own words, this remarkable woman tells of her early life as a young journalist in the crucible of Greenwich Village political and literary thought in the 1920s, and of her momentous conversion to Catholicism that meant the end of a Bohemian lifestyle and common-law marriage. The Long Loneliness chronilces Dorothy Day’s lifelong association with Peter Maurin and the genesis of the Catholic Worker Movement.

The Educated Child : A Parents Guide From Preschool Through Eighth Grade,"If you care about the education of a child, you need this book. Comprehensive and easy to use, it will inform, empower, and encourage you. Just as William J. Bennett's The Book of Virtues has helped millions of Americans teach young people about character, The Educated Child delivers what you need to take control. With coauthors Chester E. Finn, Jr., and John T. E. Cribb, Jr., former Secretary of Education Bennett provides the indispensable guide. Championing a clear ""back-to-basics"" curriculum that will resonate with parents and teachers tired of fads and jargon, The Educated Child supplies an educational road map from earliest childhood to the threshold of high school. It gives parents hundreds of practical suggestions for helping each child succeed while showing what to look for in a good school and what to watch out for in a weak one. The Educated Child places you squarely at the center of your young one's academic career and takes a no-nonsense view of your responsibilities. It empowers you as mothers and fathers, enabling you to reclaim what has been appropriated by ""experts"" and the education establishment. It out-lines questions you will want to ask, then explains the answers -- or non-answers -- you will be given. No longer will you feel powerless before the education ""system."" The tools and advice in this guide put the power where it belongs -- in the hands of those who know and love their children best. Using excerpts from E. D. Hirsch's Core Knowledge Sequence, The Educated Child sets forth a state-of-the art curriculum from kindergarten through eighth grade that you can use to monitor what is and isn't being taught in your school. It outlines how you can help teachers ensure that your child masters the most important skills and knowledge. It takes on today's education controversies from phonics to school choice, from outcomes-based education to teaching values, from the education of gifted children to the needs of the disabled. Because much of a youngster's education takes place outside the school, The Educated Child also distills the essential information you need to prepare children for kindergarten and explains to the parents of older students how to deal with such challenges as television, drugs, and sex. If you seek high standards and solid, time-tested content for the child you care so much about, if you want the unvarnished truth about what parents and schools must do, The Educated Child is the one book you need on your shelf.","['Chester E.

M. Crumbley,95/102,3.0,1129161600,Discover why reading Proust is worth the time and effort,"Alain de Botton's slim volume contains a reasonably good argument for making the considerable investment of time and energy required to read In Search of Lost Time. I don't recall the author promising that reading his book will change one's life, or that reading Proust's work will necessarily be a life-changing experience--only that it might turn out that way.I was given a dog-eared copy of How Proust Can Change Your Life by a friend whom I'd told I was considering giving Proust a go. I read maybe half of it, found it amusing, and found the portrayal of Proust amusing as well. The book seemed to fizzle out after that, but what I'd read was enough to get me started on Swann's Way. I had not expected Proust to be comical in any way, but I credit Alain de Botton for illuminating Proust's self-deprecating sense of humor. Had it not been for that, I might never have made it past the famous and seemingly interminable description of juvenile insomnia that opens Swann's Way, much less enjoyed it.Five years later, I have just finished The Captive and plan to begin The Fugitive within the next month or so. Has Proust changed my life? Well, yes. His work has attuned me to the importance of paying attention, resisting the dulling effects of habit, slowing down, finding meaning in the ordinary rhythms of life, accepting the painful inevitabilities of existence, laughing at my own foibles. There's more, but I won't bore you with it.Proust is not everyone's cup of tea. But he might be yours. And if he is, you're in for what can, in fact, be a life-changing experience. (At the rate I'm reading him, it could also be a lifelong experience.) You may not be happier, handsomer, thinner, richer, or smarter, but you just might have a better understanding of why being who, what, and where you are is worthy of your attention.If you're thinking about diving into Proust and not sure that it will be worth the effort, I'd recommend spending a few bucks on this primer first. If it inspires you to move on to the real thing, that's great. If it doesn't, you will have saved yourself hundreds of hours of what could be, for some, utter tedium. And if happiness, beauty, and wealth are what you really want, and you want them now, there's always Dr. Phil.",1

The Greek Myths,"The gold standard in Greek mythology, in a dazzling Graphic Deluxe Edition with a new introduction by the bestselling author of the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series From the creation of the world out of Chaos and the birth of the Olympians to the Trojan War and Odysseus's return, Robert Graves's superb retelling of the Greek myths has long been acclaimed as the definitive edition. Graves draws on sources scattered throughout ancient literature, using a novelist's skill to weave a crisp, coherent narrative of each myth and providing commentaries with cross-references, interpretations, and explanations based on solid scholarship. The result is a classic volume of many of the greatest stories ever told—stories of the gods, heroes, and extraordinary events that inspired Homer, the Greek tragedians, and so much of subsequent European literature.

The Greek Myths,"The gold standard in Greek mythology, in a dazzling Graphic Deluxe Edition with a new introduction by the bestselling author of the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series From the creation of the world out of Chaos and the birth of the Olympians to the Trojan War and Odysseus's return, Robert Graves's superb retelling of the Greek myths has long been acclaimed as the definitive edition. Graves draws on sources scattered throughout ancient literature, using a novelist's skill to weave a crisp, coherent narrative of each myth and providing commentaries with cross-references, interpretations, and explanations based on solid scholarship. The result is a classic volume of many of the greatest stories ever told—stories of the gods, heroes, and extraordinary events that inspired Homer, the Greek tragedians, and so much of subsequent European literature.

His debunking of the atheistic evidential argument from evil is strictly a DEFENSE, not a THEODICY. A defense is merely a logical way out. A theodicy would attempt to give the specific reasons God allows evil. Plantinga does not claim to know the thoughts of God, so by offering a defense, he modestly shows that it is logically compatible for God to coexist with evil. His argument is NOT one by analogy (contra another reviewer), rather it is a strict application of the rules of logic.Even though the book is more accessible to the public than most of his others, I imagine that someone without any basic training in philosophy may struggle with the read (but a struggle is not a good excuse not to read a good book!). In addition to the defense against evil, his exposition of the Ontological argument is very interesting, and worthwhile for anyone who intends to properly understand that argument. Those in the field of philosophy have almost universally accepted it as the theistic solution to the problem of evil. If you are an atheist, I challenge you to study his arguments to understand the rational case he is making. This will definitely be an exciting and fun read for the philosopher, as well as to the thinking and outspoken theist and atheist.(By the way, if you are looking for a good THEODICY - try MAKING SENSE OUT OF SUFFERING by Peter Kreeft, philosophy professor at Boston College.)",1

I was looking foward to Bloom consolidating some of the 20th century for me, but it wasn't to be. After I sulked a while and started reading, I have found it to be one of, if not, his most approachable and rewarding book (and I have about thirteen of his latter books). What I found especially rereadable and delightful is his essay--""The Art of Reading Poetry,"" which is in the beginning 30 pages, divided in 8 sections. Bloom takes a very practical approach towards READING poetry and gives some advice that reminds me of his assumed heir: Helen Vendler. For instance HB says we should ask ourselves 4 questions when reading a poem. The first, (roughly from memory) is what does the poem mean, and is that meaning clearly attained. Next, can we deem the poem as simply good, or is it intrinsically well-crafted. And finally does this poem transcend its time or is it a period piece? There are other nuggets that I strongly believe will make their way into anthologies across America in due time, probably once the obtuse personality of Bloom fades and we are left with just his passion and wisdom for literature.There are also introductory essays before the authors that offer us bio information, but of special interest and relevance. Just this morning I read that Willaim Blake and his wife, after a struggling marriage in the beginning, lived the rest of their life in contentment, by all accounts.As a potential buyer, don't be scared of another technical, verbose, theoretical book. And don't think BLoom is trying to make his favorite poems your favorite poems; but see that he is using these poems to illustrate how to interpret and engulf your own favorite poems. This book is Bloom at his most genial and wise, and at times his most personal.",1

The Greek myths,"The gold standard in Greek mythology, in a dazzling Graphic Deluxe Edition with a new introduction by the bestselling author of the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series From the creation of the world out of Chaos and the birth of the Olympians to the Trojan War and Odysseus's return, Robert Graves's superb retelling of the Greek myths has long been acclaimed as the definitive edition. Graves draws on sources scattered throughout ancient literature, using a novelist's skill to weave a crisp, coherent narrative of each myth and providing commentaries with cross-references, interpretations, and explanations based on solid scholarship. The result is a classic volume of many of the greatest stories ever told—stories of the gods, heroes, and extraordinary events that inspired Homer, the Greek tragedians, and so much of subsequent European literature. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.",['Robert Graves'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LJJPEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=LJJPEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Greek+myths&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin,2012-04-24,http://books.google.nl/books?id=LJJPEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Greek+myths&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],,B0007DXV60,,A2P6KAWXJ16234,Kelly (Fantasy Literature),95/101,4.0,1047427200,The White Goddess strikes again,"I could make a hobby out of ""Graves-izing"" popular stories. How about Cinderella? If Robert Graves got hold of that story, he'd say something like this: ""Cinderella's name means Ash-lady, which denotes her as the ash-pale Death-goddess of winter. She and her two stepsisters form the classic Triple Goddess. Originally, the sisters' names were probably Destruction and Pestilence. Cinderella's transformation at the hands of the Fairy Godmother was really a late patriarchal addition; no doubt the original goddess transformed herself, showing her Love-goddess face rather than her more spectral one. Her dance with the Prince is an example of the White Goddess's choice of the King of the Waxing Year as her consort. In the version that has come down to us, she loses her shoe, but certainly in the uncorrupted, original myth, it was the Prince who lost his shoe, as the sacrificial king was often marked by a limp. This can be seen in the Welsh story of Math ap Mathonwy, and Dionysos's epithets also hinted at lameness. At the hour of midnight, that is to say, the witching hour, Cinderella reveals her terrible, ravening face by turning back into the ragged Death-goddess. Undoubtedly, the story ended with Cinderella's murder of the Prince, and her mourning for him by painting her face with the ashes of his funeral pyre, as the Welsh women mourned for Llew Llaw Gyffes. The happy ending we are familiar with is actually the record of the patriarchal takeover, when the White Goddess was forcibly married to the Year-King who had become the supreme god of the new mythology."" Hey, that was fun!Graves wrote in a poem once, ""There is one story and one story only."" This story is the myth of the White Goddess, beautiful and faithless, seducing her consort and then betraying him to death at the hands of his rival for her love. This is the only story Graves can see, and everything in this book is filtered through ""White-Goddess""-colored glasses. Every myth in which a male figure dies is a record of human sacrifice to the Goddess. Every female figure is assumed to be triple, whether the myths show her in triple form or not. And he always chooses the bloodiest interpretation possible. For example, whenever the root ""Perse"" appears in a name, he insists it should really be ""Pterse"", ""destruction"". He is so caught up in his morbid mythos that he doesn't realize it might just really be ""Perse"", which means ""light"". So, certainly don't take this book as gospel. It is colored by the biases and assumptions of its author, and should definitely not be the only book you read on the subject of Greek mythology.That said, I was fascinated by _The Greek Myths_. I had trouble following his _White Goddess_, but this book is more structured and easier to keep up with. And it gave me some tantalizing ideas for my neo-pagan practice. Just because the history may be dubious doesn't mean this book can't be inspirational--as long as one remembers that the theories came from Graves and not from the ancients.",0

A well-reasoned apologia of the faith by a respected Western convert, I felt, could only be a useful and enlightening book. I was not prepared for the reality.On beginning the book I was initially disappointed by two things. First of all, Mr. Assad was a journalist. Secondly, the book was first published some 50 years ago - and the events described in it happened 20 years earlier than that. I have no objection to reading old books - far from it! - and I have in general no objection to reading books by journalists, but I tend to avoid old books by journalists. The journalist, by definition, you might say, is absorbed in the ephemera of current events; when he refers to the past, it is usually only to make a point about the present. And what may be a cogent observation about current events tends to pall quickly with time. At best, most old books by journalists are old news; at worst, downright laughable. Anybody who has tried to read an erstwhile best seller by Lowell Thomas or John Gunther will know what I mean. In addition, I feared that a book on religion by a journalist could only be superficial, so I resigned myself to making the best of what I feared was to be a bad situation; after all, I had already bought the book.It was true that the book seemed steeped in the current events of 1930: the French and British ""mandates"" in the Middle East, the Saudi struggles against the Beni Hashim and their English friends for control of the Arabian peninsula, the Sanusi battling Fascist Italy in Libya, Shah Reza Khan building a new Iran. Most of these events are ancient history to Western readers, if indeed they ever heard of them at all. But much to my surprise, the book was a startlingly good read, and it held my interest. Indeed, Mr. Assad's opening story of being lost in the desert is one of the finest pieces in its genre that I have ever read, and stands up favorably against anything written by Thesiger or TE Lawrence.I was actually halfway through the book before I finally realized that all of my preconceptions had been wrong. The book is a finely wrought description of an inner journey to his own center, along with two outer journeys - Mr. Assad's trip to Mecca to perform the Hajj which forms the outward frame of the book, and the larger journey of his own life, starting with his childhood in a Jewish family in Lvov through his presence and participation in many of the major events of the era, and how these affected his outlook.One of my earlier observations was true; if you're looking for well-reasoned arguments about Islam as a world religion, you will not find them. Instead, there are anecdotal references regarding the effect that the community of believers had on him, and in fact it is probably not overstating it to say that it was the experience of living with Muslims in a Muslim community, and coming to appreciate the world outlook of that community, that influenced him the most and led him to accept Islam.And it is precisely this understanding and interpretation of Islam in terms of the community of believers that makes this an important book - maybe more important than it was when it was originally written. It is true that the era of Western presence as a governing power in the Middle East is long over. But the point is that for well over a century, the West cared not at all about local interests in the Middle East. Not only did we arrogate to ourselves the right to rule these areas, but wittingly or not we did, and still do, tear apart the fabric of these societies by our presence and values - and the Islamic people of the Middle East resent this tremendously. I know of no other book that manages to bring a sense of this so forcefully.Mr. Assad brings up the issue of Zionism in the book, and mentions that he had made the acquaintance of Chaim Weizmann, with whom he did not see eye to eye. Within a few brief paragraphs Assad manages to describe completely and succinctly what is largely still the Arab argument against the existence of Israel, and it would benefit Westerners to become familiar with this argument if they want some understanding of the Arab position beyond the two-dimensional stereotypes found in the more sensational press currently available.Not everything about the book made me happy; I was quite dismayed at Mr. Assad's rather summary dismissal of Shiite Islam as basically an Iranian character flaw, and even more dismayed at his caricature of Iran as a nation of opium addicts. In this case I can only assume that he was reflecting the Wahabi prejudices of his bedouin friends.But these are only scattered clouds in a sunny sky. The value of the book lies in the opportunity it gives us to realize that the Middle East has a long-standing grievance against the West, whether it be England, France, Italy, America or Israel. From the Arab point of view we all look the same, and it is not nearly as easy to determine who the aggresor is than we would like to think.",1

Stanger in a Strange Land,"The original uncut edition of STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND by Hugo Award winner Robert A Heinlein - one of the most beloved, celebrated science-fiction novels of all time. Epic, ambitious and entertaining, STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND caused controversy and uproar when it was first published and is still topical and challenging today. Twenty-five years ago, the first manned mission to Mars was lost, and all hands presumed dead. But someone survived... Born on the doomed spaceship and raised by the Martians who saved his life, Valentine Michael Smith has never seen a human being until the day a second expedition to Mars discovers him. Upon his return to Earth, a young nurse named Jill Boardman sneaks into Smith's hospital room and shares a glass of water with him, a simple act for her but a sacred ritual on Mars. Now, connected by an incredible bond, Smith, Jill and a writer named Jubal must fight to protect a right we all take for granted: the right to love.",['Robert A.

I won't go into details (you can find them easily on the net) but essentially the cut down version is not written in Heinlein's ""voice"" but drastically cut down (by RAH) to fit into a length the publisher thought proper.And so it does not sound like any other Heinlein novel, and this has split the ""Stranger"" camp right down the middle. There are those to whom the original book was bible -- and those tend not to like other Heinlein works. Those of us who love Heinlein have always felt kind of ""meh"" about Stranger... until the uncut version was released (in 1991).Now, the Kindle version being sold is the cut version, so if you were a fan of that (published in 1961) you'll love this version. However, if you are not a huge fan of that version I would stay away from this Kindle version at all costs (there are easily found web versions of the uncut novel -- I'm not advocating piracy, but it's unlikely we'll ever see a Kindle uncut version as Amazon seems clueless here -- even official reviewers seem to think this version is uncut, but I can promise you it isn't, as the passages are clear and easy to find in even the sample version).One last thing -- if you have read the cut version (either this Kindle version or otherwise) you might want to give the uncut version a try. Also, if you are new to Heinlein and want to know what all the fuss is about, definitely read the uncut version. Watered down beer tastes just like that.",1

They are the ninja, the scout and the spell thief. The ninja is rewritten from the oriental adventures and the ninja of the crescent moon from the sword and fist book. The scout is a cross between a rogue and a ranger. One of the feats is skirmish which allows the scout to deal an extra d6 on any attacks made if he moves at least 10ft and increases a d6 every 4 levels. The last new class is the spell thief, their primary ability is to steal spells from spellcasters, generally one level of spell for every three of character level. This allows the spell thief to cast that spell within the hour.There are several prestige classes some from the various older book series, like the animal lord from the masters of the wild,the dread pirate, thief acrobat and the dungeon dweller from song and silence as well as many others. I particularly liked the wild plains rider as I have a area that has nomadic horse riders.There is an expansion of the skills such as allowing greater movement while climbing if you are willing to take a penalty on the check. This is repeated with many of the skills like disable device or hide. There are new feats like goad which if the intended victim fails a will save it will only attack you.There is a section of new equipment like catstink which if used requires a creature with scent to make survival check or lose the scent, or softfoot which adds a bonus to move silently. There are several alchemical capsules as well as new tools for use. I particularly liked this section as I enjoy playing rogues.There is a new section of magic items like the choker of eloquence which gives a bonus to diplomacy, bluff and perform checks. At the end of the section is a discussion of swift and immediate actions.There are 16 pages of new spells, some of which are really nice some are so-so in my opinion.There are several spells with the designation of swift and are mostly one round in duration. I liked the ranger spell hawkeye which increased range increment for bows and such by 50% and added to the spot check.The last section of the book talks about various organisations. It gives some information on various types and how to join and the advantages for joining are. There is a random chart at the end of the chapter if you are inclined to roll to see what is there.I consider this book to be a very solid addition to the line and am considering what I will foist on my players from this book.",1

A Magill,95/100,5.0,1142294400,"A neocon critique of the Iraq War, sure to raise eyebrows","When Francis Fukyama writes a book critiquing the war in Iraq and the neo conservatives who backed the policy, one must sit up and take notice. His previous book, ""The End of History,"" with its positivist view and thesis that history is inexorably marching towards liberal democracy and capitalism formed a central text in describing the neo conservative world view. Given his background, Fukuyama's decision to write a book attacking the Bush administration's Iraq policy will surely not be easily lumped with many other books opposing the war, nor will he make as easy a target for lambasting by the White House press office.Fukayama's book focuses on two critiques of the war, on practical and the other philosophical. The first offers no real surprises as it simply states facts now widely published and generally accepted by all but the most ardent supporters of the Iraq War. These include the lack of troops on the ground, the absurd idea that all Iraqis would welcome the US as liberators, failure to quickly quell looting and lawlessness after the fall of Saddam, general lack of interest in the specifics of Iraqi culture and history, bureaucratic sidelining of experts from the state department, and the list goes on. Again, the only thing that makes this particularly interesting is that this author cannot be simply dismissed with hollow phrases like ""leftist"" or ""Bush Basher.""In the second category, Fukuyama's book truly stands out for both a unique approach and perspective. Yes, the author does believe that world history moves towards democracy, but he looks wearily at the idea that American power can hasten that march through military power. However, the neo cons at the White House believed exactly that idea; that if one simply removed the stones of totalitarianism in Iraq, democracy would blossom. Accepting this given as an almost religious truism, the authors of the Iraq policy could simply ignore the cultural and historic realities that made it failure so tragically predictable. In an interesting connection, Fukuyama points to the simplistic idea held by many neo cons that the fall of the Soviet Union is almost entirely the result of the American military buildup in the 1980s, instead of one factor in a complex historical matrix. The author argues persuasively that, once having accepted the idea that military might led to this great historic sea change, one can easily conclude that military might can accomplish anything.Fukuyama is not one who believes in shrinking from the use of American power. Instead, he argues it must be used judiciously or else risk a backlash. In particular, he examines the idea that American hegemony should not frighten the world because American policy is conducted with a high degree of morality, a concept near and dear to the hearts of the neo conservative movement. Fukuyama does not reject this premise, but rightly points out that it only can be meaningful if the rest of the world believes the US is moving from a point of high minded principles. Lamenting that America now stands near alone in the world, having squandered the great outpouring of international sympathy that came after 9/11 and led to the world standing almost united in the war in Afghanistan, Fukuyama offers powerful arguments about the value of diplomacy and cooperation.In the end this more than anything else stands at this book's heart. When an American government takes a ""with us or against us"" approach, resentment and anger will follow as night follows day. Policy conducted based on high minded ideals may be all to the good, but one cannot simply dismiss real world concerns and expertise as ""old thinking."" While Fukuyama's belief in the importance of so-called ""soft power,"" (economic aid, cultural connections, and diplomatic resources) clearly fell on deaf ears in this White House one can only hope future administrations will take such ideas more seriously. In any case, citizens wishing to formulate a post-Bush foreign policy would do well to spend time with this excellent work.",0

Had never heard of him before --- but man, oh man! This book is incredible, a true page turner --- in a time when page turners really are kind of rare. Mystery-thrillers seem to follow a set formula that a seasoned fan/reader can spot from the beginning. I fell in love with Patrick and Angie and even Bubba. Lehane's characters are so REAL, you feel like you really do know them. They're screwy, quirky, flawed, funny as hell,one or two are downright psychopaths, but you're bound to love them.

Lifeskills for Adult Children,,,,,,,,,,1558740708,7.74,,,95/100,3.0,1043452800,Not enough detail for my taste,"I'm a veteran of the ""adult child"" genre, and as I was reading this book, I found myself thinking that other books in my library covered this ground much more effectively for my taste. I found the tone of this volume somewhat simplistic and the sample person-to-person interactions a bit forced (which I suppose is the point), but that made it hard for me to relate to them or imagine myself carrying out the sample exercises.Personally, I got a lot more out of _Adult Children of Abusive Parents_ by Steven Farmer, which deals with many of the same topics but uses far more detail and more real-life examples I could believe actually happened, and that made a big difference in whether I felt able to take the advice to heart. (Details ARE important to me, and I felt like _Lifeskills_ was light on them: My copy may be 200 pages long, but it uses a suspiciously large font and liberal line spacing -- only 28 lines to a page.)There's also a curious convention _Lifeskills_ uses -- three small stylized icons of a man tilting back a bottle of wine, which are used as section separators! Given that many ""adult children"" have one or more alcoholic parents, this really made me cringe.If you've never read any other books in this genre, this is probably an OK place to start. I just found that with some other books on this topic I'd read, I got more ""bang for the buck.""",1
A Tear and A Smile,"Gibran Kahlil Gibran (January 6, 1883-April 10, 1931) usually referred to in English as Kahlil Gibran. He was a Lebanese-American wirter, poet and visual artist. He was also considered as a philosopher. His best book is 'The Prophet'. It was one of the best-selling books of all time. The achievement is that the book has been translated into more than 100-language. The present book 'A Tear and a Smile' is a wonderful bunch of poetry. And a beautiful anthology. Poetry: ""I would not exchange the sorrows of my heart. For the joys of the multitude. And I would not have the tears that sadness makes. To flow from my every part turn into laughter. I would that my life remain a tear and a smile."" Poetry are filled with great thoughts and also in-depth feelings. Poetry are related to life. So one has to focus on the understanding and in depth message in each poetry. The author has nicely related the value of Tear and Smile in to his poetry. Every poem is admirable. ""The cry of your spirit and I am come to comfort it. Open your heart to me and I shall fill it with light."" Author has focussed on feelings. Spiritual feelings the author narrates the pain & sorrows in this world. Tears flush out sorrows and grief. Smile always gives confidence and how to face all the situations. When heart is filled with emotions and by the hurt feelings, then tears are there to help you out. Gibran thus narrates how sorrow of the heart & tears of sadness makes like how into joy. So a tear can lead to a smile because happiness and sorrow come hand in hand. Our sorrows purify us and makes us understand the world.",['Kahlil Gibran'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JAM9EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=JAM9EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=A+Tear+and+A+Smile&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Diamond Pocket Books Pvt Ltd,2021-08-12,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JAM9EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],1.0,B000KOI8K0,,,,95/100,5.0,923270400,The emotion behind inconsolable grief,"If you have ever loved and lost, either by death or other unbearable circumstance, if you have ever longed for your lover's touch, if you have ever seen the most awesome vision, if you have ever found happiness in your despair and tears, if you have ever seen death at your doorstep, and called for it, if you have ever wondered if anyone has ever felt these things you do, this book is certainly for you.

SON OF THE MORNING STAR,"Custer's Last Stand is among the most enduring events in American history--more than one hundred years after the fact, books continue to be written and people continue to argue about even the most basic details surrounding the Little Bighorn. Evan S. Connell, whom Joyce Carol Oates has described as ""one of our most interesting and intelligent American writers,"" wrote what continues to be the most reliable--and compulsively readable--account of the subject. Connell makes good use of his meticulous research and novelist's eye for the story and detail to re-vreate the heroism, foolishness, and savagery of this crucial chapter in the history of the West.",['Evan S.

Smith,95/100,4.0,963964800,"Jumbled, Yet Fascinating Look At Custer and the Indian Wars","Evan Connell has written a powerful book. It is a balanced presentation of George Armstrong Custer, the post-Civil War Indian Wars, Plains Indians and the myth of the Battle of the Little Big Horn.Facts abound. I started this book thinking it would primarily focus on Gen. Custer and the fight. While those topics are the framework of the book, Connell spends quite a bit of time exploring various indian chiefs, indian practices, previous conflicts and the conditions that produced one of our country's most celebrated battles. First person quotes are abundent and the author usually produces two or more sides to every episode. These explorations underscore how difficult getting at a true history is, particulary when pride and ego rest on a particular telling of an event. He has done very good research.This is a brutal book. American and indian savagry are laid bare. Warfare and existence on the frontier were not pretty. The &quot;rules&quot; of war were abandoned by both sides with regard to the taking of prisoners or the frequent butchering of women and children along with those unlucky enough to be in the path of maurading soldiers or indian bands. Connell's book leaves no doubt that American notions of racial superiority, mainfest destiny and economics created the situation in which the indians would fight in the extreme to protect their lands from white encroachment. However, the author also underscores that most of the indian tribes were brutal and ruthless when attacking other tribes, lone indians and in their own rituals and customs. Had America respected it's indian treaties, it can be argued that the indian lands still would have had atrocities visited upon them as various tribes concentrated their full time attentions on settling the wrongs each felt had been metted out by other red men. His refusal to treat the indian as a politically correct manifestation of mother nature is refreshing and allows for a very balanced telling of the story.The author has a unique writing style. He doesn't come to a fork in the road without taking it. These side tracks and tangents allow him to explore in full the charactors and milieu attendent to The Last Stand. However, they are presented in no particular order or chronology. The author paints a strong impression rather than presenting an ordered and structured telling of a compelling tale. This incohesion is so pronounced that the end of a chapter has no meaning other than to allow one to catch one's breath before plunging into the next twenty pages of free associations.My opinion of this book changed several times during my reading. In the beginning, I found it hard to get into because of it's meandering style. But the vignettes, characters, facts and writing are all compelling. His style will require some adjustment to the frequent reader of history. But, by the end the reader will know that they have immersed themselvs in a darn good story that fascinates.",0

The Storm of Steel,"Presenting the desperate conflict of the First World War through the eyes of an ordinary German soldier, Ernst Jünger's Storm of Steel is translated by Michael Hofmann in Penguin Modern Classics. 'As though walking through a deep dream, I saw steel helmets approaching through the craters. They seemed to sprout from the fire-harrowed soil like some iron harvest.' A memoir of astonishing power, savagery and ashen lyricism, Storm of Steel depicts Ernst Jünger's experience of combat on the front line - leading raiding parties, defending trenches against murderous British incursions, and simply enduring as shells tore his comrades apart. One of the greatest books to emerge from the catastrophe of the First World War, it illuminates like no other book not only the horrors but also the fascination of a war that made men keep fighting for four long years. Ernst Jünger (1895-1998) the son of a wealthy chemist, ran away from home to join the Foreign Legion. His father dragged him back, but he returned to military service when he joined the German army on the outbreak of the First World War. Storm of Steel (Stahlgewittern) was Jünger's first book, published in 1920. Greatly admired by the Nazis, Jünger remained at a distance from the regime, with books such as his allegorical work On the Marble Cliffs (1939) functioning as a covert criticism of Nazi ideology and methods. If you enjoyed Storm of Steel, you might like Edward Blunden's Undertones of War, also available in Penguin Modern Classics. 'To read this extraordinary book is to gain a unique insight into the compelling nature of organized, industrialized violence' Niall Ferguson, author of War of the World 'Hofmann's interpretation is superb' The Times 'Unique in the literature of this or any other war is its brilliantly vivid conjuration of the immediacy and intensity of battle' Telegraph 'Storm of Steel is what so many books claim to be but are not: a classic account of war' Evening Standard",['Ernst Junger'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=q-LjDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=q-LjDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Storm+of+Steel&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin UK,2016-01-26,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=q-LjDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],3.0,B000HPNRP8,,A3JD07VHDLT5FF,"isala ""Isabel and Lars""",95/100,5.0,1089417600,The best memoir of WWI,"Ernst Junger was there for the duration. He was wounded sixteen times, he lost his brother. He experienced the trench war in all its hellish glory. That's the difference between Storm of Steel and other WWI memoires like Farewll to All That, Memoires of an Infantry Officer, No News from the Western Front, etc: Junger is not anti-war; he loved it! Do not expect some dreaming idealist though. Junger was a harsh realist. Nothing is to horrifying for him to tell (and believe me - there are a lot of horrifying detail!). He took part in the major combats on the western front, so we get a rare first hand glimpse of the war, The style is vivd, yet sober. He comes across as a Prussian gentleman, not cruel, but he does what he has to do to survive.Junger later became one of the finest authors of the twentieth century. He is sadly unknown in the Anglo-Saxon world, in much due to his refusal to distance himself from Hitler (he did not embrace nazism though either). He lived an interesting life; he stopped doing LSD when he turned seventy, and he wrote a major treaty on the role of bugs in heraldry. More of his work deserves to be recognized.",1
The Fifth Discipline: The Art and Practice of the Learning Organization,"MORE THAN ONE MILLION COPIES IN PRINT • “One of the seminal management books of the past seventy-five years.”—Harvard Business Review This revised edition of the bestselling classic is based on fifteen years of experience in putting Peter Senge’s ideas into practice. As Senge makes clear, in the long run the only sustainable competitive advantage is your organization’s ability to learn faster than the competition. The leadership stories demonstrate the many ways that the core ideas of the Fifth Discipline, many of which seemed radical when first published, have become deeply integrated into people’s ways of seeing the world and their managerial practices. Senge describes how companies can rid themselves of the learning blocks that threaten their productivity and success by adopting the strategies of learning organizations, in which new and expansive patterns of thinking are nurtured, collective aspiration is set free, and people are continually learning how to create the results they truly desire. Mastering the disciplines Senge outlines in the book will: • Reignite the spark of genuine learning driven by people focused on what truly matters to them • Bridge teamwork into macrocreativity • Free you of confining assumptions and mindsets • Teach you to see the forest and the trees • End the struggle between work and personal time This updated edition contains more than one hundred pages of new material based on interviews with dozens of practitioners at companies such as BP, Unilever, Intel, Ford, HP, and Saudi Aramco and organizations such as Roca, Oxfam, and The World Bank.",['Peter M.

Crawford,95/100,5.0,1080086400,positively excellent,"All too often, I find myself acting cynically about my field and ready to dismiss just about anything as mediocre, no matter how popular or praised. Well, this is one book that I think is really excellent - for content, for clarity, for sincerity, for the stories reported in it.When I plow through a business book, I try to see if I can remember the central ideas, the essence of what the author has to say from the mass of details and stories that make up every business book. Most often, they are appalingly banal and pathetically over-applied, touted as able to solve just about every problem, in particular if a fee is paid to the authors to come and talk about it in person. I was preparted to treat this book the same way, and was simply delighted to find a truly excellent and useful book. And gee, I am glad that I can get inspired by a book in my chosen field, rather than bored!As I see it, this book has three principal ideas. First, we must think of organizations and their missions as complex systems rather than as conglomerations of isolated problems. It is pitch for the development of a holistic view - how everything interacts and what factors act upon what other factors. This is an analytical tool that can pinpoint what should be done, breaking mental habits of looking only at the bottom line of sales revenues, for example, rather than the need to provide better service or delivery times. Second, employees must be empowered to make their own decisions locally, requiring honesty and openness throughout the organization as standard practice. This enables them to question and learn, not just individually but as part of a unified team, hence the subtitle of a learning organization. Mistakes are part of this process and should be allowed as valid experiments. Third, the task of a leader is to design an organizational system within which this can all be accomplished. Rather than control all decisions in a centralized manner in accordance with a rigid plan, the leader must develop a vision of where they organization should go and then allow his employees to pursue that vision as a team with great autonomy.I have wanted to read this book for almost ten years. It was first pointed out to me by a remarkable business leader in mainland China, Zhang Ruimin, the founder of the Haier Group, as a seminal text for him. He said that he had built a learning organization in accordance with Senge's prescriptions, and after so many years, I see that indeed he did. What this book did for me was to give me a better idea of Zhang's mind and what went on in it. But it has also given me a clearer idea of many other remarkable entrepreneurs whom I have had the pleasure and honor to meet over the years in my work. As Senge explained, these men had a vision, but used the gap that existed between their vision and current reality to inspire their workers to achieve remarkable things. And they created self-reinforcing systems to do so.Another fascinating aspect of this book is that, in spite of being nearly 15 years old, it felt fresh and its examples did not feel stale and in need of updates. Many books that old extoll Japan as the model to emulate and explain why that country does everything better than everyone else. Just take a look at Porter's books! While this book has some examples from Japan, it does not fall into that trap - for me, that means its analyses have stood the test of time.This is one of the best business books I ever read - and I have read way way too many of them! Warmly recommended.",1

Most likely it seems that it depends on your personal situation and knowledge prior to reading the book.I think that if you were someone who was just making ends meet, using all of your salary to support your lifestyle (in Kiyosakian parlance, buying ""liabilities"") and doing little to save and invest (buying ""assets""), I can see that this book might serve as a wake up call and can inspire and motivate people to look for ways to possibly change their situation. Furthermore, the book's various claims, (however misleading or unrealistic as I point out below) plays right into such people's desires to learn the ""secret of success"" of the rich that if only they knew, they could quit (or abandon their plans) to go to school, quit their jobs and just invest and live off of investments the rest of their lives without working.OTOH, if like many of us, you were making a good salary WORKING but spending responsibly (i.e. limiting ""liabilities) and meanwhile trying to invest aggressively as much as we know how to do based on our unique circumstances and preferences (buying ""assets""), the book really provides no substance and stretches credibility. For us, you don't need inspiration and what specific info the book provides is either dated, incorrect, or misleading. Also for many of us, we didn't read it realizing ahead of time that it was entirely a motivational book rather than a ""methods"" book since the title alludes to ""methods"" that that rich possess that we of humbler backgrounds lack.This book makes fantastic claims. There is a quick and easy ""secret of success"" that ""the rich"" (always treated as a monolithic group) know and the rest of us don't; this ""secret information"" is far more important than hard work, getting a good education, investing wisely, or any traditional method to become rich and successful; and if you only learn ""the secret"" (translation: buy Kiyosaki's book) you, too, will be rich.According to Kiyosaki, ""the rich"" become rich by using three different strategies: 1). They form and own corporations, thus paying less taxes than people who get their income as employees. 2). They invest in real estate in certain ""secret"" ways that let them earn a lot of money with little risk or tax liability; 3). They use tips from friends for insider's trading to make a killing in the stock market. Kiyosaki's advice, in essence, is to suggest to the reader to emulate ""the rich"" by using the same tax-avoidance strategies, real-estate schemes, and insider's trading ""they"" supposedly use to get rich.There are only two tiny problems with Kiyosaki's advice. First of all, these ""secret strategies"" are NOT the way the rich actually make money; it is rather the LAYMAN'S IMPRESSION of how the rich make money, an impression based mainly on numerous TV shows and movies which portray ""the rich"" in this way. As the (excellent) book ""the millionaire next door"" shows, this description bears no more relation to how the rich actually make money than James Bond films have to actual espionage work.Second, not surprisingly, the ""strategies"" Kiyosaki proposes could work only in the movies - where, of course, the government and police are all in the millionaire's pocket, and let him ""get away with it"". If you actually try them in the real world, you will be laughed at, waste your time and money, get audited by the IRS, or worse.For example, in reality, coroprations are *not* good tax shelters. In reality, you *cannot* deduct your personal expenses as ""business expenses"", or have your corporation give you ""tax-free gifts"" such as trips to Hawai or Rolex watches, as Kiyosaki claims. Doing so would get you audited and stiffly fined (or worse.) Also, in reality, ""insider's trading"" is a felony which could land you in jail. Finally, in reality, Koyisaki's real-estate advice is either illegal (as in his claim of using his cat as a ""business partner""), immoral (as in getting ""good deals"" from unsophisticated sellers, apparently based on the principle of ""it is immoral to let a sucker keep his money""), or doesn't work in the real world (such as his claims that he offered 275K for a 450K building and ""they agreed to 300K"", or that a bank agreed to take 50K instead of 60K for property he bought ""simply because it was a cashier's check."")...This book, in summary, paints a fantasy picture of the world, and gives ""financial advice"" that will make you a laughing stock at best and put you in jail for insider's trading or tax evasion at worse.If you have dreams of being the next Gates, Trump, etc, I'd say go for it. But don't give up your day job just yet based on Kiyosaki's fantasy notions because the real world doesn't work that way. The bottom line is that whether you work hard at a profession as an employee or whether you work hard to invest and build businesses, you will need to work. It is safe to say that while a few people will be able to invest and build businesses and live off of their assets without working, many of us won't be able to pull it off. There's nothing wrong with trying but don't do it with the mistaken notion that you'll automatically be better off than if you kept your job and invested carefully over a lifetime because you probably won't be.",0
"The Garden of Eden, A Novel","A sensational bestseller when it appeared in 1986, The Garden of Eden is the last uncompleted novel of Ernest Hemingway, which he worked on intermittently from 1946 until his death in 1961. Set on the Côte d'Azur in the 1920s, it is the story of a young American writer, David Bourne, his glamorous wife, Catherine, and the dangerous, erotic game they play when they fall in love with the same woman. ""A lean, sensuous narrative...taut, chic, and strangely contemporary,"" The Garden of Eden represents vintage Hemingway, the master ""doing what nobody did better"" (R. Z. Sheppard, Time).",['Ernest Hemingway'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kpSCYmXR5K4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=kpSCYmXR5K4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Garden+of+Eden,+A+Novel&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Simon and Schuster,2002-07-25,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kpSCYmXR5K4C&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],15.0,B000HZ8ZR8,,A3TEH90X39WC8F,"Stuart W. Mirsky ""swm""",94/99,4.0,997660800,It's clear why he never published this one in his lifetime!,"Hemingway, at his best, was a master of the short story form and a reasonably good, though not outstanding, novelist. At his death he left a number of unfinished manuscripts, material in various stages of development that he was working on and, in some cases, struggling with. Knowing this, I hesitated to pick this book up for a long time, not wanting to read the master's own discards and figuring he knew what was good enough for publication and what was not and that what he left, at his death, was manifestly not.Reading ISLANDS IN THE STREAM some years back, I felt confirmed in this belief for that was a clumsy and self-absorbed effort and I think he must have known that. Later, I had a similar experience when I tried TRUE AT FIRST LIGHT, the most recent posthumous addition to his opus. More recently, however, I was bored for lack of fresh reading material and so picked up THE GARDEN OF EDEN to read on a plane trip.Although this one was unfinished at his death and ends in such a fashion as to drive that sad point home, it is nevertheless outstanding Hemingway. Aside from a few lapses here and there and the usual Hemingway tendency toward an almost juvenile self-absorption, this one positively hums with the power of the old Hemingway prose. As sharp and subtle as his best short fiction and as fresh and dynamic as his best novel, THE SUN ALSO RISES, this book unfolds, in crisply vivid detail, the struggle of a youthful writer to hang onto his sense of self-worth and devotion to his work in the face of his passionate love for a difficult and spoiled woman.Yet it's plain why Hemingway may have agonized over this one and held it back from publication, for the man it reveals is not the public persona he cultivated for most of his life. The protagonist in this tale, an avatar of the author (as in most of his works), is here a passive and unassertive sort who is unable to deal effectively with the woman he has married. Instead he succumbs to one of her whims after another though he feels they will somehow unman him, allowing her to change him outwardly while losing himself in the satisfaction of his writing, the only thing, besides his wife, we are led to believe he really loves. And yet when his wife brings another woman into their lives to create a menage a trois, the hero does not rebel though he finds himself more and more a plaything of the two women. Is he flattered by their attention and sexual interest, though his wife takes delight in being able to control and manipulate him to her will? And is she jealous of the one thing he has outside of her, his writng, and is that the motive that drives her to turn him into a creature she can wholly control?Hemingway's best works were rooted in his own life experiences and, indeed, as he plumbed those, his well went regrettably dry in his later years, something he sensed and agonized over at the end. Yet this tale is fresh and alive in ways that many of his other later works were not. The one really regrettable thing about it was that he never finished it so there are still some rough parts, where his control slips and he says what he should be implying (by his own famous dictum) and the end tails off into an insipid and half-baked moment of insight leaving the reader feeling cheated.Hemingway, had he focused on this one and finished it in his lifetime, would not have let it stand this way. But it's plain why he did not for this was not the man he wanted others to see. Still, this one is finely wrought and true, for the most part, to the old Hemingway &quot;voice&quot; and talent. I'm not sorry I finally broke down and read it.",1

Force Of Reason,The Force of Reason and the Logic of Force investigates the concept of force through various 'episodes' in the history of philosophy. The author argues that force arises on the basis of the distinction of reality and mere appearance. The book looks at figures who reduce force to something other than itself as well as figures who develop a 'logic of force' that allows them to trace the operation of force without such a reduction.,['R.

Her third book has not yet been translated into English. But this book gives us plenty to consider in the meantime. Fallaci's first book in this trilogy was the Rage and the Pride published in Italian newspapers shortly after 911 and then made into a very short book. There is still the rage from the first book, but now it is coupled to a powerful unrelenting reason making this book, in my mind, far more powerful.This book is significantly longer and delves into much greater depth in considering the Muslim problem. Fallaci speaks with a burning passion about the problems posed by Islamic supremacism. She presents a view of the Muslim threat to Europe in unambiguous terms undiluted by political correctness. And therein lies the rub for most of her detractors. Fallaci tells the truth and they can't handle the truth. It flies in the face of their cozy ecumenical multicultural world view in which all values are rendered equal by relativism. This of course is pure sophistry. Islam is a conquering faith that is spread by the sword. It's tradition teaches supremacism and subjugation of the infidel. She paints a very compelling picture of a ""religion"" committed to world domination.From the book: And whoever believes in the myth of moderate Islam should reread the stories of the burned convents and monasteries, of the profaned churches, of the raped nuns, of the Christian or Jewish women abducted to be locked away in their harems. He should ponder on the crucifixions of the Cordoba, the hangings of Granada, the beheadings of Toledo and Barcelona, of Seville and Zamora. (The beheadings of Seville, ordered by Mutamid: the king who used those severed heads, heads of Jews and Christians, to adorn his palace. The beheadings of Zamora, ordered by Almanzor: the vizier who was called the-patron-of-the-philosophers, the greatest leader Islamic Spain ever produced). Christ! Invoking the name of Jesus meant instant execution. Crucifixion, of course, or decapitation or hanging or impalement. Ringing a bell, the same. Wearing green, the colour exclusive to Islam, also. And when a Muslim passed by, every Jew and Christian was obliged to step aside. To bow. And mind to the Jew or the Christian who dared react to the insults of a Muslim. As for the much-flaunted detail that the infidel-dogs were not obliged to convert to Islam, not even encouraged to do so, do you know why they were not? Because those who converted to Islam did not pay taxes. Those who refused, on the contrary, did.""Fallaci speaks of the vitiation of the word peace by the so called ""peace movement"" who she calls opportunists ""who mimic the one-way pacifism of Immanuel Kant and resort to war with brazen-faced impudence. They do it in the name of humanity, of course. And, more than often, waving a revolutionary flag. Because also a revolution is war."" Plato says that war exists and will always exist because it comes from human passions. Fallaci does not believ in the masochism of turning the other cheek. She declares unambiguously and proudly, ""my war is right. Legitimate, dutiful, right. And it is not true that all wars are wrong. Sometimes they are right. Legitimate, dutiful, right."" Fallaci does not shrink from the challenge of critical and ""reasoned"" thought. She in fact establishes a heirarchy of values and unequivocally endorses the superiority of the Western world relative to that of the world created by the sons of Allah.The myth of the ""moderate"" Muslim is a diabolical politically correct canard forged on the anvil of ""tolerance"". And to the extent that we've accepted this monstrous invention we've allowed ourselves to become denuded and emasculated. Fallaci does not hesitate to point this fact out. That we still allow ANY Muslim to immigrate to this country is a testimony to our failure to understand the problem and a failure of will to solve this crisis.Make no mistake, Islam is a best understood as a hate cult with the capacity to destroy civilization. William Durant in his ""The Story of Civilization"" succinctly stated, [Islam is] ""probably the bloodiest story in history."" He called it a ""discouraging tale, for its evident moral is that civilization is a precious good, whose delicate complex order and freedom can at any moment be overthrown by barbarians invading from without and multiplying from within."" The bitter lesson, Durant concluded, was that ""eternal vigilance is the price of civilization. A nation must love peace, but keep its powder dry.""A moderate Muslim is simply a lax Muslim who does not follow the prescripts and tenets of the Islamic ""faith."" This in no way speaks to the issue of whether or not a viable moderate strain of Islam which rejects Islamic hegemony exists. It does not. The Koran is replete with commands to wage war against the infidel (non Muslim) wherever you may find them. There is simply nothing moderate about Islam.Alexis de Tocqueville said the following: ""I studied the Koran a great deal. I came away from that study with the conviction there have been few religions in the world as deadly to men as that of Muhammad. So far as I can see, it is the principal cause of the decadence so visible today in the Muslim world and, though less absurd than the polytheism of old, its social and political tendencies are in my opinion to be feared, and I therefore regard it as a form of decadence rather than a form of progress in relation to paganism itself.""Today we are told that what is needed in the Middle East is democracy. This has become our mantra. But as ""Spengler"" from the Asia Times recently said, ""Something more than democracy is required for peace and prosperity, and that is a people committed to good rather than evil. Democracy in the Middle East means something quite different: Hamas in Gaza and the West Bank, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and Muqtada al-Sadr in Iraq. The sooner President Bush changes the subject, the better.""Fallaci has been stricken by cancer. And one would have thoght that her voice would be somewhat tempered by her debility. This is not the case. Quite the opposite. I got the impression that Fallaci has been liberated by her disease. Any restraints that she may have felt in the past (and believe me there were precious few) have been jettisoned and she pulls absolutely no punches.Fallaci has said: ""I find it shameful and see in all this the rise of a new fascism, a new Nazism. A fascism, a nazism, that much more grim and revolting because it is conducted and nourished by those who hypocritically pose as do-gooders, progressives, communists, pacifists, Catholics or rather Christians, and who have the gall to label a warmonger anyone like me who screams the truth. I see it, yes, and I say the following. I have never been tender with the tragic and Shakespearean figure Sharon. (""I know you've come to add anotherscalp to your necklace,"" he murmured almost with sadness when I went to interview him in 1982.) I have often had disagreements with the Israelis, ugly ones, and in the past I have defended the Palestinians a great deal. Maybe more than they deserved.""Oriana's is the voice of rage, the voice of pride, and now, even more so, the voice of reason. Her Italian pride and Western pride are evident throughout the book. Her pride in the rich cultural traditions of the West, that have been trampled upon and spit upon, literally, by the Muslims, is inspiring. Although Fallaci ostensibly rejects the Deity she invokes His name continually. And so I say, God bless Oriana Fallaci.",1

Warren approaches the subject of BDSM with humor, seriousness, safety in mind, and perhaps most of all a love of the subject. The book has obviously been well researched and well written. It is a no non-sense work in which aspects of BDSM are covered. Whether it be games to play in the playroom like whipping or bondage to the intricate relationship between a dominant and their submissive. I had a great time reading this book and I learned a lot about the subject. I would highly recommend this book to anyone at all even remotely interested in BDSM. In fact I would have given this book 5 stars but for one reason, whoever was the proofreader missed so many obvious spelling and punctuation errors that it continually drove me to distraction. I would be avidly reading a section and then WHAM, a spelling mistake. The first few times I ignored it, after that it got really annoying. Grammatical errors aside, I would still recommend this book to anyone and in fact already have recommended it to several of my friends. My copy is currently on loan to a friend in Indiana (and I am not sure that I will ever get it back, he said he wanted to borrow it to a friend in Michigan). A great book to read on your own, with a playmate, or with a spouse. It will give you a lot of ideas and probably make your life just a little bit more kinky!",1

During my 74 years, I read the book many times. After I retired, I made four trips to that part of the world, and spent many months each time searching for that wonderful Shangri-La dream. If you have never read Hilton's classic, and you are a person with an optimistic spiritual outlook, then The Lost Horizon is a must for you. If you read it and want to believe it, then you should visit Burma and the temples of the ancient city of Pagon, and then spend time in the three kingdoms of the Himalayas: Nepal, Ladakh and Bhutan, in that order. You will be moved to tell others, or write about your spiritual experience. I was so moved. May your days be filled with the magic of life. Sirrom",1
The First World War,"More than two hundred maps illustrate general political and military strategy, major campaigns, and important stages in naval and air conflicts and the war on the Western and Eastern fronts.","['Arthur Banks', 'Alan Warwick Palmer']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2l7MnQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=2l7MnQEACAAJ&dq=The+First+World+War&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Leo Cooper Books,2000-09-13,http://books.google.nl/books?id=2l7MnQEACAAJ&dq=The+First+World+War&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],2.0,B0008EH6IM,,A3AUN9QA56JV2R,Felix Sonderkammer,94/99,3.0,1153526400,Good for what it is,"As a one-volume narrative outlining the major events of the First World War, this book succeeds. It is a great introduction to the war. I wish, however, to state my reservations about the book.One oddity is that the first three chapters cover the events leading to the war, but the last chapter ends abruptly with the armistice. It would have been nice to have a chapter on the Treaty of Versailles.The book incorporates two previously published articles, as the acknowledgements acknowledge. This leads to the repetition of certain data, as it appears that they were not sufficiently edited to fit in with the rest of the book.Keegan is British, and it is obvious. He emphasizes repeatedly how the British army was never defeated by the Germans except in one campaign. The Australians are praised as the world's greatest soldiers without further elaboration. He explicitly blames Germany's naval construction campaign preceding the war for the war itself, presumably because it challenged Britain's benign supremacy. The deaths of British soldiers are lamented with poignancy that overflows into sentimentality.To be fair, the book was written for a British audience, and these excesses are much more modest than they might have been. Keegan seems to have tried hard to be evenhanded, and these excesses are largely superficial and forgivable.Lastly, Keegan admits that this book does not break new ground. A glance at the endnotes reveals that most of the material from this book was taken from secondary sources. Each chapter seems to have come from three or so books. Thus, this is not a work of history so much as a gloss on history written by others.",1
The Egyptian Book of the Dead: The Book of Going Forth by Day,"For the first time in 3,300 years, The Egyptian Book of the Dead: The Book of Going Forth by Day: The Papyrus of Ani is showcased in its entirety in seventy-four magnificent color pages. Maybe the most stunning presentation of this book in 3300 years: Upon death, it was the practice for some Egyptians to produce a papyrus manuscript called the Book of Going Forth by Day or the Book of the Dead. A Book of the Dead included declarations and spells to help the deceased in the afterlife. The Papyrus of Ani is the manuscript compiled for Ani, the royal scribe of Thebes. Written and illustrated almost 3,300 years ago, The Papyrus of Ani is a papyrus manuscript with cursive hieroglyphs and color illustrations. It is the most beautiful, best-preserved, and complete example of ancient Egyptian philosophical and religious thought known to exist. The Egyptian Book of the Dead is an integral part of the world's spiritual heritage. It is an artistic rendering of the mysteries of life and death. For the first time since its creation, this ancient papyrus is now available in full color with an integrated English translation directly below each image. This twentieth-anniversary edition of The Egyptian Book of the Dead has been revised and expanded to include: Significant improvements to the display of the images of the Papyrus. A survey of the continuing importance of ancient Egypt in modern culture. A detailed history of Egyptian translation and philology since the discovery of the Rosetta Stone in 1799. And, a state-of-the-art Annotated Bibliography and Study Guide for Ancient Egyptian studies. As the third revised edition, the entire corpus of this critical work is given its most accessible and lavish presentation ever. Includes a detailed history of Egyptian scholarship, an annotated bibliography and study guide, and several improvements to the color plates. Makes an excellent gift for people interested in world history and ancient religions.",,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GOS2jgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=GOS2jgEACAAJ&dq=The+Egyptian+Book+of+the+Dead:+The+Book+of+Going+Forth+by+Day&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Chronicle Books,2015-01-20,http://books.google.com/books?id=GOS2jgEACAAJ&dq=The+Egyptian+Book+of+the+Dead:+The+Book+of+Going+Forth+by+Day&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],,B0007US9I8,,A2519788C514WB,"Ian M. Slater ""aylchanan""",94/99,5.0,1063756800,Ian Myles Slater on How to Succeed in the Next World,"It would hardly seem necessary to add another review, but it seems it would be helpful to make a few things clear. ""The Book of the Dead"" is not, as some reviewers seem to think, a (not very good) encyclopedia of Egyptian life. Nor is it a compendium of mythology (the narrative content is remarkably small). Nor is it (an early but durable misconception) ""the Egyptian Bible"". The name applies to a number of collections of spells, prayers, hymns, and instructions (the contents varying from copy to copy, and over time), which were included in tombs. They were intended to assist the deceased in achieving a happy existence (and avoiding destruction) in the afterlife. The contents are, in this context, quite utilitarian. To the Egyptians it was ""Coming Forth by Day"" (as a glorified spirit), and those who could afford it commissioned beautifully executed copies as essential equipment for their long-term future. Many copies, including the Papyrus of Ani, included numerous illustrations (some exquisite) of major and minor gods, the intended owner and his family, and scenes of the (very earthly) Next World. The collection emerged from earlier bodies of tomb and coffin literature during the New Kingdom, and versions continued to be produced into Roman times.This particular edition reproduces (beautifully) the color edition of the New Kingdom ""Papyrus of Ani"" published by the British Museum in 1890. That version was edited by E.A.W. Budge -- who had purchased the scroll in Egypt -- in collaboration with another Victorian-era Egyptologist, Le Page Renouf. This modern presentation is actually an improvement, since computer manipulation has allowed the rejoining of material which Budge arbitrarily separated when preparing the brittle papyrus for shipment by pasting sections on wooden blocks. (The papyrus has, inevitably, deteriorated since it was unrolled. The few modern reproductions of images from it which I have seen were a letdown after the early descriptions. James Wasserman's Preface, which mentions this problem, refers to photographs in an Egyptological series, which I have not seen.)That first edition was always rare and expensive, and hardly ever available today, and then at a very high price indeed. It was followed in 1895 by a popular edition, prepared by Budge, containing the text in a hieroglyphic transcription, interlinear transliterations and translations, a more polished translation, and an elaborate introduction and other apparatus, including supplementary material from roughly contemporary texts, and some black and white line-drawing versions of the illustrations. This latter edition has been reissued for decades by Dover Publications, and at first glance it looks like a wonderful bargain. The arrangement looks promising, and the hieroglyphic font was a brilliant example of nineteenth-century design.Unhappily, Budge was not only writing in the nineteenth century, he was already behind the times even then. His transliteration is utterly obsolete, and his smooth translation misleading (although the interlinear translation is sometimes helpful figuring out the original word order when comparing translations by others). His introduction and commentary are full of errors (or then-current misconceptions), and he devotes a lot of space to almost-forgotten controversies (useful to the serious student, a waste of time to most readers). I enjoy looking at it, but have never trusted it.Budge went on to edit a ""complete"" Book of the Dead, the hieroglyphic text of which is still cited, and a translation of that text, still (or recently) in print (under the Arkana and other imprints) and also misleading. (There are also other editions of the 1895 version of the Papyrus of Ani, with less lavish layout.)For anyone who has longed for the color plates of Budge's original edition, and dreamed of a modern translation of what it says, this edition will meet most demands. It does not (alas!) have a modern transliteration, but that is its only real lack. It contains a limited, but useful, commentary. There are translations, based on critically edited versions of those ""Chapters"" found in the Papyrus of Ani, on the same pages as the facsimiles. Like Budge's popular edition, it also contains translations of important material from other copies of the collection from the same period (known in the scholarly literature as ""The Theban Recension""). The translations are based on those by the late Raymond Faulkner, which also appear, with other material, in another ""Book of the Dead"" translation.So, if you are looking for an outstanding example of Egyptian funerary literature and art from the New Kingdom, you will probably want this book. If you are looking for a general introduction to ancient Egypt, a reference work, or comprehensive anthology of ancient Egyptian literature, try something else. (You will probably want to return to this if what you find there interests you, but that is another matter.)",1

A quick browse through easily reveals a number of these, the first of which being at the first line of Genesis. There are also a number of explications to replace the frustrating ""See note at Psalm 15:2"" type of notes. Now they sometimes tell you why you should see it. Many of the earlier notes are also revised based on comments from seminary students, professors and pastors to bring them up to date with current conservative evangelical scholarship. There are also a few more charts in this version, a couple of new color maps (only dropping one, the pointless ""The World as it is Today"" from the previous edition). The typography is also slightly different, as are the icons used to denote archeology and life application passages. The font used for the headers is also different (in my view a slight improvement since it makes it easier to quickly spot stories and parables), and the comfortable font used for the Bible text itself remains unchanged. The standard edition is 2198 pages not including color maps, while the 1995 version was 2172. The spine of the leather version is also more stylish than the 1995 edition, simply stating ""Zondervan NIV Study Bible"" and ""NIV"" and ""Zondervan"" near the bottom. The 1995 edition said ""The NIV Study Bible"" ""New International Version"" ""Words of Christ in Red Letter"" and ""Zondervan,"" which made it a little busy. Oh, yes--the new version contains no family record pages, apparently realizing that study Bibles are used for study and not as heirlooms. There's only a nice presentation page and then it gets right into the timelines. All in all I highly recommend this update--and that's only after a quick browse-through! Frank",1
Stop Walking on Eggshells: Taking Your Life Back When Someone You Care About Has Borderline Personality Disorder,,,,,,,,,,157224108X,,,,94/99,5.0,1021075200,I wish I had had this book years ago,"I was in the midst of a divorce from a man our marriage counselor had said had bipolar disorder when I discovered this book. I literally had a physical reaction of relief flooding through me as I read page after page describing elements of my husband's behavior that had concerned me for years: the need to live in chaos; the deification or demonization of the people in his life; the unpredicability of what would set off his anger next; and all the anger and criticism directed at me, even as he told me several times a day that he loved me. More important, it contains very useful information about what I can do to make our relationship less hellish. We have small children, so divorced or not, we in each other's lives for a long time. This book helped me to understand my now-ex better; it reminded me that his anger and threats cover a lot of pain. At the same time, it gave me clear guidelines about what I needed to do to protect myself. I had to acknowledge my own failure to set boundaries, which is crucial with dealing with this kind of problem.The description of how a person with BPD deals with divorce was so dead-on, I joked that they had stolen it from my life.I had come to hate and fear my ex-husband. I feared that, even after our divorce, he would continue to bully and threaten me. This book is helping me to establish a workable relationship with him.",1
The Force of Reason,,['Oriana Fallaci'],,http://books.google.com/books?id=RtTJtwEACAAJ&dq=The+Force+of+Reason&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,2004,http://books.google.com/books?id=RtTJtwEACAAJ&dq=The+Force+of+Reason&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Europe'],4.0,B000N662RQ,,A3IPSECQAUAT8V,JanSobieski,94/99,5.0,1142553600,Another tour de force by the inestimable Fallaci.,"This is the second in Fallaci's trilogy. Her third book has not yet been translated into English. But this book gives us plenty to consider in the meantime. Fallaci's first book in this trilogy was the Rage and the Pride published in Italian newspapers shortly after 911 and then made into a very short book. There is still the rage from the first book, but now it is coupled to a powerful unrelenting reason making this book, in my mind, far more powerful.This book is significantly longer and delves into much greater depth in considering the Muslim problem. Fallaci speaks with a burning passion about the problems posed by Islamic supremacism. She presents a view of the Muslim threat to Europe in unambiguous terms undiluted by political correctness. And therein lies the rub for most of her detractors. Fallaci tells the truth and they can't handle the truth. It flies in the face of their cozy ecumenical multicultural world view in which all values are rendered equal by relativism. This of course is pure sophistry. Islam is a conquering faith that is spread by the sword. It's tradition teaches supremacism and subjugation of the infidel. She paints a very compelling picture of a ""religion"" committed to world domination.From the book: And whoever believes in the myth of moderate Islam should reread the stories of the burned convents and monasteries, of the profaned churches, of the raped nuns, of the Christian or Jewish women abducted to be locked away in their harems. He should ponder on the crucifixions of the Cordoba, the hangings of Granada, the beheadings of Toledo and Barcelona, of Seville and Zamora. (The beheadings of Seville, ordered by Mutamid: the king who used those severed heads, heads of Jews and Christians, to adorn his palace. The beheadings of Zamora, ordered by Almanzor: the vizier who was called the-patron-of-the-philosophers, the greatest leader Islamic Spain ever produced). Christ! Invoking the name of Jesus meant instant execution. Crucifixion, of course, or decapitation or hanging or impalement. Ringing a bell, the same. Wearing green, the colour exclusive to Islam, also. And when a Muslim passed by, every Jew and Christian was obliged to step aside. To bow. And mind to the Jew or the Christian who dared react to the insults of a Muslim. As for the much-flaunted detail that the infidel-dogs were not obliged to convert to Islam, not even encouraged to do so, do you know why they were not? Because those who converted to Islam did not pay taxes. Those who refused, on the contrary, did.""Fallaci speaks of the vitiation of the word peace by the so called ""peace movement"" who she calls opportunists ""who mimic the one-way pacifism of Immanuel Kant and resort to war with brazen-faced impudence. They do it in the name of humanity, of course. And, more than often, waving a revolutionary flag. Because also a revolution is war."" Plato says that war exists and will always exist because it comes from human passions. Fallaci does not believ in the masochism of turning the other cheek. She declares unambiguously and proudly, ""my war is right. Legitimate, dutiful, right. And it is not true that all wars are wrong. Sometimes they are right. Legitimate, dutiful, right."" Fallaci does not shrink from the challenge of critical and ""reasoned"" thought. She in fact establishes a heirarchy of values and unequivocally endorses the superiority of the Western world relative to that of the world created by the sons of Allah.The myth of the ""moderate"" Muslim is a diabolical politically correct canard forged on the anvil of ""tolerance"". And to the extent that we've accepted this monstrous invention we've allowed ourselves to become denuded and emasculated. Fallaci does not hesitate to point this fact out. That we still allow ANY Muslim to immigrate to this country is a testimony to our failure to understand the problem and a failure of will to solve this crisis.Make no mistake, Islam is a best understood as a hate cult with the capacity to destroy civilization. William Durant in his ""The Story of Civilization"" succinctly stated, [Islam is] ""probably the bloodiest story in history."" He called it a ""discouraging tale, for its evident moral is that civilization is a precious good, whose delicate complex order and freedom can at any moment be overthrown by barbarians invading from without and multiplying from within."" The bitter lesson, Durant concluded, was that ""eternal vigilance is the price of civilization. A nation must love peace, but keep its powder dry.""A moderate Muslim is simply a lax Muslim who does not follow the prescripts and tenets of the Islamic ""faith."" This in no way speaks to the issue of whether or not a viable moderate strain of Islam which rejects Islamic hegemony exists. It does not. The Koran is replete with commands to wage war against the infidel (non Muslim) wherever you may find them. There is simply nothing moderate about Islam.Alexis de Tocqueville said the following: ""I studied the Koran a great deal. I came away from that study with the conviction there have been few religions in the world as deadly to men as that of Muhammad. So far as I can see, it is the principal cause of the decadence so visible today in the Muslim world and, though less absurd than the polytheism of old, its social and political tendencies are in my opinion to be feared, and I therefore regard it as a form of decadence rather than a form of progress in relation to paganism itself.""Today we are told that what is needed in the Middle East is democracy. This has become our mantra. But as ""Spengler"" from the Asia Times recently said, ""Something more than democracy is required for peace and prosperity, and that is a people committed to good rather than evil. Democracy in the Middle East means something quite different: Hamas in Gaza and the West Bank, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and Muqtada al-Sadr in Iraq. The sooner President Bush changes the subject, the better.""Fallaci has been stricken by cancer. And one would have thoght that her voice would be somewhat tempered by her debility. This is not the case. Quite the opposite. I got the impression that Fallaci has been liberated by her disease. Any restraints that she may have felt in the past (and believe me there were precious few) have been jettisoned and she pulls absolutely no punches.Fallaci has said: ""I find it shameful and see in all this the rise of a new fascism, a new Nazism. A fascism, a nazism, that much more grim and revolting because it is conducted and nourished by those who hypocritically pose as do-gooders, progressives, communists, pacifists, Catholics or rather Christians, and who have the gall to label a warmonger anyone like me who screams the truth. I see it, yes, and I say the following. I have never been tender with the tragic and Shakespearean figure Sharon. (""I know you've come to add anotherscalp to your necklace,"" he murmured almost with sadness when I went to interview him in 1982.) I have often had disagreements with the Israelis, ugly ones, and in the past I have defended the Palestinians a great deal. Maybe more than they deserved.""Oriana's is the voice of rage, the voice of pride, and now, even more so, the voice of reason. Her Italian pride and Western pride are evident throughout the book. Her pride in the rich cultural traditions of the West, that have been trampled upon and spit upon, literally, by the Muslims, is inspiring. Although Fallaci ostensibly rejects the Deity she invokes His name continually. And so I say, God bless Oriana Fallaci.",1

Dennis Lehane is definitely a member of this elite, and *Darkness, Take My Hand* demonstrates why.Like Michael Connelly, Robert Crais, and some others in the P.I./lone wolf cop genre, Lehane has written his books in such a way that they are best read &quot;in order,&quot; as each book builds on the previous one(s) in terms of the development of his main characters. Consequently, readers should read Lehane's first book, *A Drink Before the War*, before picking up *Darkness, Take My Hand*, which is the second in the series.In most respects, however, *Darkness* is a richer, deeper, and better-crafted mystery than was Lehane's debut novel. He has utilized a well-worn but still effective plot theme here, that of the long-term serial killer. This provides the basis for the mystery element of the book, and also, perhaps unfortunately, the blood-and-guts angle, as well. Yes, there is a lot of gore in this book, and lots of discussion in graphic detail of the depravities of which human beings are capable. Lehane's work is NOT for the faint of heart.What separates Lehane from many other mystery writers, even good ones like Robert Parker, is his sheer literary talent. His writing is gloriously rich, descriptive (particularly in terms of his depictions of the Boston area setting for his stories), and insightful, and he goes to great pains to develop in some psychological depth his main characters, Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro. Consequently, this enables Lehane to take his work well beyond the cliches that are so typical of shamus novels.If you like the work of Parker, Connelly, Crais, Barre, Burke, etc., you should definitely start reading Lehane--in order, of course.",1

The world was a safer and simpler place back then and this book does much to make us realise just how much has been irretrievably lost since.Not that this was ever Ransome's intention, of course. He was simply drawing upon his own boyhood experiences (from a yet earlier time) as well as contemporary ones of the children of a family friend. He used these to weave an enchanting tale that would remind those same children (by then returned `home' to the deserts of the Middle East) of a happy summer spent sailing in England.The story's strong basis in reality (albeit several separate realities, as it were), tempered with Ransome's love of sailing (and his knowledge of Lake District life), imbue the book with a strong sense of authority. Both the text and the author's own pen-and-ink illustrations also have an endearing charm that comes across even now, some 70 years after the book was first published. One of the great things about this book (and indeed, the whole series of books that was to follow) is that Ransome avoids most of the stereotypical treatments of children's roles that his contemporaries (as well as later authors) continually espoused. He always manages to treat (nearly!) all of his characters as equal partners in their activities, whatever their age, gender or background. The children are also afforded a greater respect and rather more freedom by the adults than is common these days, too.And while the children's `adventures' are nothing fantastical or extra-ordinary when viewed from an absolute perspective, Ransome manages to convey so much of the children's own excitement at their activities that the reader can't help being drawn into their world and so come to share some of that same excitement. All in all, this a delightful book and should be on everybody's essential reading list, regardless of their age!",1

The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View,"""[This] magnificent critical survey, with its inherent respect for both the 'Westt's mainstream high culture' and the 'radically changing world' of the 1990s, offers a new breakthrough for lay and scholarly readers alike....Allows readers to grasp the big picture of Western culture for the first time."" SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE Here are the great minds of Western civilization and their pivotal ideas, from Plato to Hegel, from Augustine to Nietzsche, from Copernicus to Freud. Richard Tarnas performs the near-miracle of describing profound philosophical concepts simply but without simplifying them. Ten years in the making and already hailed as a classic, THE PASSION OF THE WESERN MIND is truly a complete liberal education in a single volume.",['Richard Tarnas'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fPiZGAETdHMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=fPiZGAETdHMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Passion+of+the+Western+Mind:+Understanding+the+Ideas+that+Have+Shaped+Our+World+View&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Ballantine Books,2011-10-19,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fPiZGAETdHMC&source=gbs_api,['Philosophy'],5.0,0345368096,12.89,A3L5PE36CZZO5M,Marcus Anthony,94/98,5.0,1134086400,A Passionate Mind - Note the Passion!,"The title of the book says it all, and not to be overlooked. This is a book that seeks to ascertain the passion that underpins the development of the western mind. Tarnas does a tremendous job of what is the Herculean task of tracing the roots of that development from the Ancient Greeks, through the birth of Christianity, the middle ages, the enlightenment and the birth of the modern world.Make no mistake. This is NOT a text defining the means by which modernist science came to be the one and only defining truth of the cosmos. Those with a modern western mindset or scientific predilection might be lulled into this impression in the early chapters. But such an initial misunderstanding, to be fair to Tarnas, would be more due to the bias of the modern mind, rather than a function of the text. For throughout the development of his narrative, Tarnas is painstaking in his description of the interplay of the spiritual, the philosophical, and the empirical/scientific. I noted that a prior viewer fell into this trap, no doubt expecting Tarnas to conclude with a denunciation of the spiritual and philosophical vestiges of prehistory, depositing these schools into the waste bin of History, whilst announcing the triumph of the modernist worldview. Far from it. Tarnas' penultimate analysis examines what he calls ""the crisis in modern science"" and the emergence of postmodern thought, both of which undermined the roots of certainty. Yet the postmodernist too may be dismayed when Tarnas concludes in his epilogue with a broad sweep of the hand, finally positing an essentially spiritual teleological thrust to the very human development he has traced. It may be anathema to those within the dominant modernist science and postmodernist schools, where spirituality and grand narrative are respectively derided - but it is nonetheless a brave attempt to make sense of it all beyond the respective materialist and relativist stranglehold of the modern and postmodern discourses.But it is not necessary to agree with Tarnas' worldview to benefit from this fine text. The 95% of the book that traces the history of the interplay between the often opposing spiritual/metaphysical and skeptical/empirical/scientific forces within western history is well worth the journey. I highly recommend the text for anybody wanting a broad overview of some of the most influential minds of the western world in the last three millennia.It may be a little light on the twentieth century history of science. So, if you want a History of Science from the modernist perspective read John Gribbin's ""Science: a History"" or Andrew Gregory's ""Eureka!"" If you want a summative account of the modernist perspective on History/Evolution, read Bill Bryson's ""A Brief History of Everything."" But if you want something that broadens the horizons, Tarnas may be the man for you.Marcus T. Anthony, author of ""The Mind Reader"" and ""Integrated Intelligence.""",1
Zeno's Conscience (Everyman's Library Classics & Contemporary Classics),"Responding to his therapist's suggestion that he use writing as therapy, Zeno chronicles his own long struggle with quitting smoking. Originally published as The Confessions of Zeno in 1923. Reprint. 15,000 first printing.",['Italo Svevo'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=21NmvyHkxEsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=21NmvyHkxEsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Zeno%27s+Conscience+(Everyman%27s+Library+Classics&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Vintage,2003,http://books.google.com/books?id=21NmvyHkxEsC&dq=Zeno%27s+Conscience+(Everyman%27s+Library+Classics&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],,0375413308,13.66,,,94/98,5.0,1015286400,A Comic and Inventive Masterpiece,"This book is so wonderfully inventive and the character of Zeno Cosini so lovably comic, that I often wonder why it's not more widely read and loved. It was first published in Italy as La coscienza di Zeno, and James Joyce, no less, championed its cause and helped the English translation come into being. Still, the English speaking world, for some unknown reason, continues to ignore this wonderful book.The protagonist of the book, Zeno Cosini, is a man at odds with himself. Hilarious odds. He loves analysis, but hates his analyst. He's neurotic to the core, but his desire to rid himself of his neuroses seems to be superseded by his amazing, and very funny, ability to rationalize things away.When Zeno's despised analyst encourages him to keep a journal (write a memoir), Zeno does so even though he is lazy and fools himself into believing exactly what it is he wants to believe. A passionate smoker, who passionately wants to quit (naturally, since this pits him against his own worst enemy, himself), he begins his journal by recounting his various attempts at quitting smoking.For Zeno, the quitting is the thing. He doesn't care how many days he goes without smoking. He doesn't care how many times he's failed in his attempts to quit. What exhilarates him, is the feeling he gets when he smokes, what he tells himself, will be his last cigarette. The problem is, Zeno needs to feel that exhilararion again. And again. And the only way to feel it again, is to quit smoking again, which necessitates taking up smoking yet again. You get my drift.Smoking isn't Zeno's only problem in this book. Far from it. As a man who needs to be perpetually backsliding, Zeno wavers between a law degree versus a chemistry degree, then decides to join his family's business instead. He pines for the beautiful Ada, but marries her homely sister, Augusta, instead, simply to prove to himself that Ada no longer tempts him. Naturally, he proves no such thing.Svevo's writing, at least in this translation from the original Italian is elliptical and convoluted. Zeno will begin a sentence telling us he still loves Ada very much and then end it by saying he feels nothing for her at all. But it's not confusing. Not in the slightest. Zeno's contradictions and Svevo's convolutions make for high hilarity and a comic character that is both lovable and memorable. Italian was Svevo's third language (after the Trieste dialect and German) and some contend that his choppy style is due to this fact. I don't think so. I think he deliberately wrote this way for maximum comic effect. And it works. Beautifully.Zeno Cosini is a liar. He lies both to himself and to others. His lies to his doctors are some of the most hilarious passages in the book. But even though he's a liar, Zeno Cosini is one very wise and wonderful man. By the time World War I is approaching, Zeno is an elderly man who seems to have found the recipe for inner peace and la dolce vita: ""Sorrow,"" he says, ""and love--life, in other words--cannot be considered a sickness because they hurt."" Zeno Cosini may have lied to himself about the pain of life, but he never ran away from it. This is definitely a book everyone should read. It's a classic, not only of Italian, but of world, literature.",1

Patients are typically told they will be unlikely to live to see the next morning unless they undergo surgery right away. Studies examining the survival rate of patients who successfully choose to eschew surgery and opt for other means of addressing their illness reveal this pitiful sales pitch for the nonsense it truly is. It appears the only thing truly in danger if patients start refusing open heart operations is the ability of the surgeon to keep up the lease payments on his new Mercedes.McGee also presents a highly critical expose' of the field of angiogragphy. He reveals that the most effective form of angiogram has been typically confined to use in research settings, while the less effective version is the one commonly used in the clinical setting to make the all-important decision on whether or not to operate.McGee also takes a shot at the cholesterol theory. He highlights how the theory has it's origins in flawed animal experiments performed by Russian researchers at the beginning of the twentieth century, and then goes on to highlight the many other studies that have failed to show any benefit from cholesterol lowering.McGee doesn't just attack the medical industry and then run - he discusses low risk treatments like EDTA chelation therapy that are typically ignored by drug-obsessed mainstream medicine.The only flaw with the book is the author's praise for Dean Ornish and Nathan Pritikin, both who promoted spartan diets with unhealthy recommendations for unnaturally low fat intakes. Ornish, for example, published a study where the arteries of an intervention group reportedly widened in comparison to a group not recieving the intervention treatment. Ornish's treatment group recieved a multiple intervention treatment - excercise five days a week, smoking cessation, meditation and group counselling in addition to a low fat vegetarian diet. McGee claims those who highlight the fact that this was a multiple intervention are ""missing the point"". I totally disagree. Ornish used several different treatments in his intervention group but when speaking with journalists and writing for the public, talks as if the low fat diet was the decisive factor in his study. One cannot in good conscience make this claim when there is absolutely no proof to back it up - one of the most basic rules of science is to control your variables. All Ornish can claim from his study is that a MULTILPE intervention, encompassing all the tactics he used, was successful in widening arteries. We know that excercise can widen arteries, and that was one of the interventions Ornish used. There is no evidence a vegan diet can achieve this effect. Ornish should be honest enough to admit this, but instead he persistently bad mouths all but the most austere low fat diets. Unfortunately McGee fails to pick up on this, so I would recommend one keep this in mind whilst reading this section of the book.Heart Frauds' strong point is its' thorough discrediting of the entire heart disease industry, and the tactics used by this industry to ensure its continued future profitability. If you are a heart disease patient, or have a friend or loved one who has CHD, I would highly recommend this book. I would also recommend Uffe Ravnskov's ""The Cholesterol Myths"" , the best examination of the cholesterol issue I have read to date. Ravnskov's book also contains an enlightening discussion on the hugely popular statin drugs; McGee's book was written before the rise of these drugs.",1

THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA,"The Phantom of the Opera is a novel by French writer Gaston Leroux. Christine Daaé travels with her father, a famous fiddler, throughout Europe, and plays folk and religious music. When Christine was six years old, her mother died and her father was taken to rural France by a patron, Professor Valerius. While Christine was a child, her father told her many stories about the ""Angel of Music"", who is the personification of musical inspiration. Christine meets and befriends the young Raoul, Viscount of Chagny. One of Christine and Raoul's favourite stories is one of Little Lotte, a girl who is visited by the Angel of Music and possesses a heavenly voice. Christine now lives with ""Mamma"" Valerius, the elderly widow of her father's benefactor. She eventually is given a position in the chorus at the Paris Opera House (Palais Garnier). She begins hearing a beautiful, unearthly voice which sings to her and speaks to her. She believes this must be the Angel of Music and asks him if he is. The Voice agrees and offers to teach her ""a little bit of heaven's music"". The Voice, however, belongs to Erik, a physically deformed and mentally disturbed musical genius who was one of the architects who took part in the construction of the opera house. He is in love with Christine.",['Gaston Leroux'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kBK0AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=kBK0AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=THE+PHANTOM+OF+THE+OPERA&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,BookRix,2019-06-14,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kBK0AwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],3.0,B000E39CZW,,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""",94/97,4.0,1241481600,No one sees the angel,"The mask, the music, the dark mysteries, and the tortured, deformed genius who just wants love. ""The Phantom of the Opera"" is so well known that its story needs no explanation.But Gaston Leroux's novel is still a spellbinding experience, full of atmospheric horror, a sense of gothic mystery, and lushly evocative language. But its crown jewel is Erik: a magnificently tortured anti-hero who inspires more horror, pity and sympathy than the rather flat hero and heroine.The Paris opera house is said to be haunted by a ghost with a ""death's head,"" who demands a small salary and a reserved box. Despite the sightings and fears of ballerinas and stagehands, the new managers are determined to stamp out this ridiculous story -- despite threatening letters and increasing accidents that happen around them.Meanwhile, budding diva Christine Daae is taking Paris by storm, although nobody quite knows who taught her how to sing. And when her childhood friend Viscount Raoul de Chagny pays her a visit, he hears a passionate exchange between her and a man -- but there's no man there. She credits her new vocal abilities to the Angel of Music, but of course, that self-same Angel is the opera ghost.As the Phantom becomes even more attached to Christine, Raoul soon finds that the ghost is actually a half-mad, horribly deformed musical genius named Erik -- and that after Christine saw his true face, he made her become engaged to him. The young lovers plan to run away together, but the ""Angel of Music"" isn't about to allow his beloved Christine to leave him...Apparently there actually were some odd events -- including rumours of an opera ghost -- happening when Gaston Leroux began writing ""The Phantom of the Opera."" And it's a credit to his imgination that he was able to spin a some odd facts into a harrowing, heartbreaking love triangle that's based on music, obsession, adoration, and a bit of pity. And, of course, a frighteningly sympathetic ""villain.""Admittedly the style is very ""penny dreadful"": melodramatic and overloaded on prose. But Leroux's talent shines through -- he drapes the book in a haunted atmosphere, full of snowy graveyards, dark opera backstages and underground labyrinths, all with Erik's presence hovering over it. The plot is mostly a slow, satiny procession toward the inevitable blowup, but Leroux does tinge it with scenes of romantic drama, a feeling of dread, one shocking action scene, and even some quirky humour at times.And Leroux's writing is simply astounding as he describes the corpselike appearance of Erik (""... tore his terrible dead flesh with my nails"") and his ""death's"" head appearance at the party. But he also excels at the more poignant moments -- Erik's final, rambling monologue to Christine after she kisses him is heartbreakingly clumsy and saddening.Though Christine and Raoul are the hero and heroine of the book, they're actually kind of flat. Erik is the real star -- an arrogant genius who is also pitifully lonely. And insane. Despite his crazed behavior -- which results in at least two deaths -- it's hard not to feel sympathy for someone cursed with such a ghastly appearance, and so starved for human contact that a single kiss changes his life (""... he tried to catch my eye, like a dog sitting by its master"").Despite being a bit overblown in the style of its time, ""The Phantom of the Opera"" is a triumph of atmosphere, horror, and one of the most memorably sympathetic ""villains"" that you can find on the shelves.

The novel revolves around the penniless childhood of Frank McCourt and begins in America with four-year-old Frank and his three year-old brother Malachy, who bears the same name as his father, and the infant twins, Eugene and Oliver, and the memories of the baby Margaret, ""already dead and gone."" Your heart goes out to the poor family, blessed with a loving mother, Angela, and yet cursed with a father who means well, but is constantly drunk or yearning for the ""pint,"" as they call it. Early in his life, McCourt's family moves to Ireland, with help from his aunts and grandmother. Unfortunately, money is not easily found in Ireland either, and the McCourt family migrates from home to home, barely surviving on the few shillings Malachy McCourt doesn't spend at the local pub. The McCourts experience tragedy upon tragedy. His physical romance with a young lady named Theresa Carmody sick with consumption, his unfortunate habit to ""interfere with himself,"" and the sad moment when in a drunken stupor on his first pint he strikes his own mother causes Frank to fear he is doomed to an eternity in hell. Unbelievably, despite all of the terrible things that happen in Frank's childhood, there are moments described in the book that give the reader a complete sense of joy and hope. I immensely enjoyed this memoir and would recommend it to any reader. I was especially enamored of the style of writing in which Frank McCourt chose to write. The words seemed as if they gently tumbled directly out of the mouth of the seven-year-old Frankie, or mischievously flew from Frank as an thirteen-year-old ""working man."" This novel was exquisitely written and is a jewel to read, as well as a treasure to remember.",1
The Quantum Quark,"Discusses ideas and stories related to the study of quantum chromodynamics, one of the four fundamental forces of nature that controls the universe in which we live, in an accessible and entertaining study.",['Andrew Watson'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ip50x8IOfnEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=ip50x8IOfnEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Quantum+Quark&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Cambridge University Press,2004-10-07,http://books.google.nl/books?id=ip50x8IOfnEC&dq=The+Quantum+Quark&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Science'],1.0,0521829070,,A4720ULNWTXZV,"Autodidact Andy ""IndiAndy""",94/97,5.0,1103068800,QED to QCD for the serious & intent lay-reader,"The Quantum Quark by Andrew WatsonIn the preface, Watson explains his book ""...focuses on quantum chromodynamics, the essentials of how it works and how it came into being."" He goes on to say ""At the modest cost of a complete story...The Quantum Quark explores QCD in more detail than all other books on particle physics intended for a wider readership."" And finally assures the reader, ""...this is a pleasant stroll through great ideas, and not a textbook."" I agree on all accounts.Let me qualify to whom I think this book will attract.Some of us are deeply curious, intelligent & interested folks - actively seeking answers and doggedly pursuing the richness of fundamental physics at a readership that spans a range well past the ""golly-gee!"" pop-physics level (e.g. Hawking/Green) but striving, reaching, stretching on tip-toes below the University academic level with its rigorous mathematical quantification proofs and rules. While it is meant for a serious lay-reader and undeniably non-mathematical in its presentation, this is definitely not light reading. People who aren't afraid of becoming a little lost while navigating the figurative `forest through the trees' can have courage this book will guide them if they're patient and willing to be led. To be sure, the dedicated reader will aquire a nodding acquaintance with concepts of conservation laws, symmetries, gauge theory, and U(1) X SU(2) & SU(3) group theories (which ultimately account for and lie at the root of the most fundamental physical laws) and last, but not least, a good conceptual grip of QCD. A willingness to do some re-reading will bode you well. The trip can be somewhat heavy going with its deep, abstract and technical description of a fundamentally mathematical subject - but it is well worth the wear & tear on the intellectual soles of your mind. Ultimately, this is an account of humanity's pinnacle intellectual achievement.OK, so what have we got here?TABLE OF CONTENTS1 Introduction 12 Symmetry 93 The quantum world 194 Toward QCD 1105 The one number of QCD 2696 The gregarious gluon 2887 Quarks and hadrons 3058 Quarks under the microscope 3289 Much ado about nothing 37010 Checkerboard QCD 391Appendix 1 A QCD chronology 413Appendix 2 Greek alphabet & SI prefixes 426The introduction does its job setting the scope of subjects: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), the Electro-Weak force, and last, but principally, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) a.k.a. the theory of the Strong Force. It brushes on experiments in high-energy physics that bring the constituents of the Standard Model to light.After the introduction, we're treated to a little history of the mathematicians and physicists who brought us Group Theory and a sketch of the properties of groups (i.e. identity element, closure, associativity & the inverse element). Descriptions and brief examples are given for O(2) orthogonal and SO(2) special orthogonal (abelian) transformations plus mention of associated dimensional 2x2 matrices; non-abelian SO(3) groups are discussed and the U(1)XSU(2) and SU(3) groups are revealed to be the fundamental abstract spaces of particle physics in a nutshell. Lie groups are briefly mentioned as well.The next major section, ""The Quantum World"", is my favorite material in this book. It starts with the fact that the measured magnetic moment anomaly of QED demonstrates its superior standing as the crown achievement of theoretical & experimental physics. Basic quantum mechanics topics are effectively covered:Energy quanta (Planck's constant h), wave phase & interference, Uncertainty Principle, Schrodinger, the principle of least action and Feynman's sum over paths.The elements quickly evolve in relative complexity and abstraction - ultimately leading towards a clearly developed connection between QED to QCD. The progression takes us through:mass-energy relations in Relativity, matter-antimatter pair production, Fermion and Boson spin & statistics and Pauli's Exclusion principle, quantum fields, the four-momentum, virtual particles, vacuum polarization, Green's functions, Feynman diagrams, vertex interactions, self-energy, infinite divergences, perturbation and renormalization program (dimensional regularization), effective low-energy field theory, Fermi's theory of weak interactions to Weinberg/Glashow/Salam and Veltman/t'Hooft Nobel prize winning contributions in the electroweak realm, and finally the all important gauge principle including the example of changes in potentials and changes in global vs. local phase.I'm now going to do the author a grave disservice by reviewing the remainder of the book in an all too brief summarization. The majority of the book plumbs the depths of QCD. Andrew brings us by the experimental facilities for a thorough inspection of the accelerators & detectors (BNL RHIC, Fermilab CDF, CERN-LEP, DESY, KEK-BELLE & SLAC). He gives complete coverage of the physicists responsible for its development and associated milestones. To name just a few of the many discussed in great detail: Yukawa - Isospin, mesons; Yang-Mills - CP violation, Gell-Man - the Eightfold Way; `the particle zoo', families, Quark-Gluon, flavordynamics, inelastic scattering, color charges; Nambu - spontaneous symmetry breaking; the Higgs mechanism & weak neutral currents; Gross, Wilczek & Politzer - Asymptotic Freedom.Watson judiciously included countless diagrams to illustrate important concepts and fundamental interactions plus many photographic pictures of physicists, experimental devices and facilities. The back of the book includes a good glossary and a nice annotated ""Further reading"" section that breaks suggested titles in easy reading, not-so-easy reading, and `hard core' sections.That's it. Altogether a serious undertaking - I hope you are challenged by it and thoroughly enjoy it as much as I have!p.s.

Dr. Mendelsohn gives a thorough introduction to making INFORMED decisions about your child's health in this consise, down-to-earth manual.&quot;How to Raise a Healthy Child&quot; does two very important things. First, it gives parents information about common childhood behavior, illnesses and accidents so that they can treat their child at home when possible and can discern when medical help is necessary. Second, it warns parents about questionable practices and attitudes common in the medical community.It is important for parents to realize, though, that the book is a little dated and that some things have changed for the better (for example, pediatrics does not seem to be as formula-happy as it once was and now favors natural breast feeding). However, some things are as bad as ever or even worse (a respected private hospital near me has close to a 50% C-section rate when research shows that 95% of births are uneventful if allowed to take their natural course).The greatest benefit of this book is that it will give you the frame of mind needed to make safe judgement calls when a doctor tells you you &quot;must&quot; do such-and-such for your child.In the end, you may wish to do further research before making final decisions about things like vaccines, which seems to be a very emotional issue for some. For example, one reviewer here referred to the author as &quot;biased&quot; against vaccines but only refuted the least relevant point made in the book, ingnoring several others; this made me wonder whether the reviewer is biased in favor of vaccines. Parents should read various books and articles, pro and con, before making such choices. (By the way, questions about vaccines are mounting in the vetrinary community as well.)&quot;How to Raise a Healthy Child&quot; ought to be in every parent's library. It can save you heartache and money and can save your child needless (and sometimes dangerous) medical treatment.",1

The Prophets,"Zinderend debuut over de verboden liefde tussen twee jongens en de allesverwoestende invloed van de slavernij 'Uit De profeten spreekt een poëtisch, hartstochtelijk humanisme.' De Groene Amsterdammer Isaiah was van Samuel en Samuel was van Isaiah. Dat was altijd zo geweest, en zou ook altijd zo blijven. In elkaars aanwezigheid waren hun lichamen niet langer een lege huls en vonden ze een reden voor hun bestaan. Maar wanneer de plantage zich tegen hen keert, wordt hun liefde ineens gezien als een gevaar voor de harmonie onder hun lotgenoten. In deze hartverscheurende roman roept Robert Jones jr. de stem op van zowel de onderdrukten als de onderdrukkers, en legt zo de ziel van de slavernij bloot. De profeten is een verhaal over de pijn van de slavernij, maar ook over de hoop en de schoonheid van de liefde. De pers over De profeten: 'Met De profeten heeft Robert Jones jr. een roman geschreven die een waardige plaats verdient tussen de verhalen van Baldwin, Morrison, Colson Whitehead, Alice Walker, Ralph Ellison en vele andere schrijvers die de Amerikaanse literatuur veelstemmiger hebben gemaakt en de Amerikaanse geschiedenis veelzijdiger.' De Groene Amsterdammer 'Een poëtisch […] slavernijepos, dat tegelijk een loflied op de tijdloze kracht van de liefde is; óók de liefde tussen twee zwarte mannen.' Het Parool 'Jones bewijst dat hij een buitengewone schrijver is, die poëzie haalt uit elk beeld en elke weerkaatsing van het licht.' The New York Times 'De profeten […] roept het beste van Toni Morrison op, maar is tegelijkertijd een uniek en virtuoos werk.' The Guardian 'Een schitterend portret van black queerness en een somber verslag van slavernij in het vooroorlogse Zuiden, opgeschreven in Jones’ lyrische maar indringende proza.'

Any one who would stand up to the pope and say 'I'd rather die than convert' (when trying to get the Roman Catholic Church to drop 'conversion of the Jews' as an official aim of the church) has the sort of integrity of belief and identity that I aspire to and most likely will never attain.Heschel's book `The Prophets' became an almost instant classic. Simply reading through the chapter titles and subtitles (a partial list of titles appears at the bottom of this review) will give a sense of the breadth and depth of this work.Heschel sees an urgent need for prophets and prophecy in today's world. 'The things that horrified the prophets are even now daily occurrences all over the world.' In examining the prophecies of Amos, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Nathan, &c;, he discerns the common strands of the word of God in all that they said and did, and teaches the reader how to discern similar prophetic aspects in today's world.`The prophet is human, yet he employs note one octave too high for our ears.'The Bible says, let him who has ears to hear, listen. Alas, ordinarily we do not have the hearing range to be able to give adequate attention and comprehension to today's prophetic voices. Most often the voice of the prophet is one we do not want to hear (look at how the Israelites reacted to their prophets!). Prophets were often seen as doom-sayers and problematic people.Indeed, every prediction of disaster is in itself an exhortation to repentance. The prophet is sent not only to upbraid, but to 'strengthen the weak hands and make firm the feeble knees.'Every prophetic utterance, according to Heschel, has to have within its core a message of hope. Without hope, without a promise to greater community and participation in the love of God, there is no true prophecy. The road may be hard and long, involving pain and even death, but in the end, the prophet's goal is greater life for all.`To be a prophet is both a distinction and an affliction.'Being a prophet has never been a chosen profession. Indeed, like Jonah, we'll often go to extraordinary lengths to avoid even the smallest call to prophecy. Prophetic voices are inconvenient, not least of which to the person charged to be the speaker of that voice. Yet the prophet is much more than a mouthpiece.`The prophet claims to be far more than a messenger. He is a person who stands in the presence of God.'The prophet becomes one with God in many ways, yet remains a human being. This creates a tension in the prophet, as Heschel writes about Isaiah:`Indeed, two sympathies dwell in a prophet's soul: sympathy for God and sympathy for the people. Speaking to the people, he is emotionally at one with God; in the presence of God, beholding a vision, he is emotionally at one with the people.'Yet prophecy has its limits.`A prophet can give man a new word, but not a new heart.... Prophecy is not God's only instrument. What prophecy fails to bring about, the new covenant will accomplish: the complete transformation of every individual.'It was the prophet who, long before ideas of political unity and divers peoples living together in community, first conceived of the idea of a unity that binds all human beings together.Read and prepare to be enlightened, inspired, irritated, and educated.Chapters include:- What manner of man is the prophet?- History- Chastisement- Justice- The Theology of Pathos- The Philosophy of Pathos- Anthropopathy- The Meaning and Mystery of Wrath- Religion of Sympathy- Prophecy and Ecstasy- Prophecy and Poetic Inspiration- Prophecy and Psychosis (there is a fine line between prophecy and madness, after all!)`This, then, is the ultimate category of prophetic theology: involvement, attentiveness, concern. Prophetic religion may be defined, not as what man does with his ultimate concern, but rather what man does with God's concern.'",1

"The first and last freedom,","ORIENTAL & INDIAN PHILOSOPHY. If truth can set us free, where do we find it? In ""The First and Last Freedom"", Krishnamurti argues that we will not find truth in formal institutions, nor in organised religions and their dogmas, nor in any guru or outside authority; for, according to Krishnamurti, truth can only be realised through self-understanding. Controversial and challenging, yet always enlightening, Krishnamurti guides us through society's common concerns, such as suffering and fear, love and loneliness, sex and death, the meaning of life, the nature of God, and personal transformation - consistently relating these topics to the essential search for pure truth and perfect freedom.

A. Felton,94/97,5.0,977961600,A classic among classics,"What I am going to write about &quot;The First And Last Freedom&quot; (TFaLF) applies to almost every book Krishnamurti (K) wrote. This was K's first book (1954), and might be his best. It always amazed me that K could say basically the same thing over and over in answer to so many philophical and spiritual questions, and yet it almost always seemed fresh, just as re-reading this first book of his seemed to me this time around.In philosophical terms I think that it's important to say that what K taught falls into what is termed the &quot;via negativa,&quot; which are paths like Zen that promulgate &quot;the way that is no way,&quot; the system that is no system, that the only way to realize the eternal is to simply *be,* be aware, at every moment, to face life and who one is with absolute honesty, directness, and clarity. Let me also say as caveats that you do not need to want to realize the eternal to study K, and that realizing the &quot;ineffable&quot; is surely a path that many people could care less about! To each his own, for sure.K is not going to be popular to self-absorbed New Age types who are at times superficially talking about &quot;enlightenment&quot; and &quot;love,&quot; while other times taking their spiritual temperatures to see if they are aware of themselves enough. On the contrary he often referred to our petty concerns as silly and stupid, not to insult us, but rather to try to effect a kind of catharsis where we simply see ourselves exactly as we are, w/o pretense, w/o belief systems, w/o indentifying with the sundry crutches that many of us surround ourselves with, precisely to avoid just seeing exactly who we are. The term K coined for this constant self awareness was &quot;choiceless awareness.&quot; To my mind choiceless awareness is like the occham's razor of spiritualilty - the clearest, most direct way to realize the eternal is simply to know who you are, at each moment, to face yourself absolutely squarely, w/o judgement,choicelessly, w/o beliefs, w/o any systems of thought or philosophies. I have always seen the truth of his simple saying, &quot;beliefs separate.&quot; Think of how many wars and conflicts there have been because people confuse the symbols that lead to &quot;truth&quot; with the actuality of just seeing what is from moment to moment.Some of the spiritual teachers these days seem to be saying that the the spiritual path is an easy one, that if we see ourselves as spiritual that is enough, something I call spirituality by proclamation. K himself realized that choiceless awareness can be a very arduous path.While K's choiceless awareness certainly leads to a life of contemplation, he never advocated withdrawing from society as many such paths of &quot;renunciation&quot; suggest. In fact he said many times, in this book and almost all others, &quot;life is relationship.&quot; Part of the process of knowing oneself is in relationship to other people, individually and collectively. As we observe ourselves choicelessly we must also learn to relate to others in the same way, especially w/o the psychological memory that taints many moments when we are present with another but crowwded with memories of past hurts and desires. I often like to think that all of us simply bounce off or resonate with one another; no one has the absolute truth, and each of us can learn from others in relationship, if we can simply just *be* present.There has, I guess since the time of the Greeks, been a philosophical conflict between being and becoming. K's teaching emphasizes the former, unequivocably. Whether or not you agree with K, I do feel it is very instructive to see the conflicts and tensions that are created by those who are obsessed with ceaseless doing in order to become, who have to identify with some tribe, nationality, or belief system, who cannot seem to just be who they are w/o such crutches.On a personal note, I believe (!) that I have evolved more from K's simple path of choiceless awareness than from any other teaching I've studied because I feel that it is the most direct way to whatever truth is possible to realize. Unfortunately I do find it painful to see my own faults and desires so clearly! I am not certain that an adult who comes to K's work can rid themselves of all the psychological garbage so deeply conditioned from the past, to heal oneself completely and in so doing go beyond the ego. I actually prefer Jung's individuation to egolessness.Of course this one review is not doing justice to K's teaching. Fortunately he wrote more than 30 books, many of which were collections from talks and discussions he had, with many &quot;gurus&quot; and the very important physicist David Bohm. There are also many videos and tapes of fascinating dialogues available from the Krishnamurti Foundation in Ojai, CA. The introduction to TFaLF was written by Alduous Huxley, who therein defined the spiritual crises that K's teaching addressed and outlined K's direct approach to the &quot;truth&quot; as well as anyone who wrote about K.",1

In addition, he felt that our schools did a very poor job of preparing young people for what life was all about. This book presented at least one partial solution to both problems: have a school course in survival, whose final test was to be dropped onto some unknown 'wilderness' planet for a week and forced to actually survive. Around this basic concept Heinlein fashioned what is probably one of the best of his so-called 'juvenile' novels.Roderick Walker is the prime character, a young man with some doubts about whether he is really ready to take the final exam in this course. With some encouragement and advice from his older sister, he decides to proceed, going through the 'gate' to a new world where nothing is familiar, where everything must be viewed as potentially deadly. But after managing to survive for the prescribed time, there is no pick up signal, no return gate, and Rod slowly comes to the conclusion that, regardless of what has gone wrong, he must make a go of really living long term on this new world. Along with other class survivors, a small society is formed, initially with Rod as the nominal leader.From this point, Heinlein manages to show the essentials of how and why a government is formed, what type of government make sense for a small group, how a society protects itself from 'bullies' (the only truly deadly animal is the two-legged variety), the contribution made by both sexes to a properly functioning society, just what makes a man a man, and the essential qualities of a leader. All buried within a fine adventure story of just how the little group builds itself from an unrelated bunch of people huddling in a cave to a bustling, forward looking industrious town, with excellent characterizations of not just Rod but most of the people around him, and with very little direct preaching, but rather showing his points as results of the events and actions of his characters.Heinlein's typical unforced, simple American prose style is much in evidence here, making both dialog and descriptions seem perfectly natural. This makes for a very fast reading experience, with a lot of his philosophical points sliding in under the reader's conscious radar, only to wake you up at 3AM with an 'Oh, yeah! That makes sense.' And perhaps you will come away from this book, as I did, thinking that the idea of a school course in survival is something that should actually be implemented.Everyone, from teens to adults, homemakers to rugged individualists, engineers to social workers, can enjoy this book. There are very few works that can appeal to such a wide range of audience as this one does, but this is something that Heinlein made a habit of. Written almost fifty years ago, it reads just as well, if not better than anything published today.",1
The Prophets,"Zinderend debuut over de verboden liefde tussen twee jongens en de allesverwoestende invloed van de slavernij 'Uit De profeten spreekt een poëtisch, hartstochtelijk humanisme.' De Groene Amsterdammer Isaiah was van Samuel en Samuel was van Isaiah. Dat was altijd zo geweest, en zou ook altijd zo blijven. In elkaars aanwezigheid waren hun lichamen niet langer een lege huls en vonden ze een reden voor hun bestaan. Maar wanneer de plantage zich tegen hen keert, wordt hun liefde ineens gezien als een gevaar voor de harmonie onder hun lotgenoten. In deze hartverscheurende roman roept Robert Jones jr. de stem op van zowel de onderdrukten als de onderdrukkers, en legt zo de ziel van de slavernij bloot. De profeten is een verhaal over de pijn van de slavernij, maar ook over de hoop en de schoonheid van de liefde. De pers over De profeten: 'Met De profeten heeft Robert Jones jr. een roman geschreven die een waardige plaats verdient tussen de verhalen van Baldwin, Morrison, Colson Whitehead, Alice Walker, Ralph Ellison en vele andere schrijvers die de Amerikaanse literatuur veelstemmiger hebben gemaakt en de Amerikaanse geschiedenis veelzijdiger.' De Groene Amsterdammer 'Een poëtisch […] slavernijepos, dat tegelijk een loflied op de tijdloze kracht van de liefde is; óók de liefde tussen twee zwarte mannen.' Het Parool 'Jones bewijst dat hij een buitengewone schrijver is, die poëzie haalt uit elk beeld en elke weerkaatsing van het licht.' The New York Times 'De profeten […] roept het beste van Toni Morrison op, maar is tegelijkertijd een uniek en virtuoos werk.' The Guardian 'Een schitterend portret van black queerness en een somber verslag van slavernij in het vooroorlogse Zuiden, opgeschreven in Jones’ lyrische maar indringende proza.'

Any one who would stand up to the pope and say 'I'd rather die than convert' (when trying to get the Roman Catholic Church to drop 'conversion of the Jews' as an official aim of the church) has the sort of integrity of belief and identity that I aspire to and most likely will never attain.Heschel's book `The Prophets' became an almost instant classic. Simply reading through the chapter titles and subtitles (a partial list of titles appears at the bottom of this review) will give a sense of the breadth and depth of this work.Heschel sees an urgent need for prophets and prophecy in today's world. 'The things that horrified the prophets are even now daily occurrences all over the world.' In examining the prophecies of Amos, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Nathan, &c;, he discerns the common strands of the word of God in all that they said and did, and teaches the reader how to discern similar prophetic aspects in today's world.`The prophet is human, yet he employs note one octave too high for our ears.'The Bible says, let him who has ears to hear, listen. Alas, ordinarily we do not have the hearing range to be able to give adequate attention and comprehension to today's prophetic voices. Most often the voice of the prophet is one we do not want to hear (look at how the Israelites reacted to their prophets!). Prophets were often seen as doom-sayers and problematic people.Indeed, every prediction of disaster is in itself an exhortation to repentance. The prophet is sent not only to upbraid, but to 'strengthen the weak hands and make firm the feeble knees.'Every prophetic utterance, according to Heschel, has to have within its core a message of hope. Without hope, without a promise to greater community and participation in the love of God, there is no true prophecy. The road may be hard and long, involving pain and even death, but in the end, the prophet's goal is greater life for all.`To be a prophet is both a distinction and an affliction.'Being a prophet has never been a chosen profession. Indeed, like Jonah, we'll often go to extraordinary lengths to avoid even the smallest call to prophecy. Prophetic voices are inconvenient, not least of which to the person charged to be the speaker of that voice. Yet the prophet is much more than a mouthpiece.`The prophet claims to be far more than a messenger. He is a person who stands in the presence of God.'The prophet becomes one with God in many ways, yet remains a human being. This creates a tension in the prophet, as Heschel writes about Isaiah:`Indeed, two sympathies dwell in a prophet's soul: sympathy for God and sympathy for the people. Speaking to the people, he is emotionally at one with God; in the presence of God, beholding a vision, he is emotionally at one with the people.'Yet prophecy has its limits.`A prophet can give man a new word, but not a new heart.... Prophecy is not God's only instrument. What prophecy fails to bring about, the new covenant will accomplish: the complete transformation of every individual.'It was the prophet who, long before ideas of political unity and divers peoples living together in community, first conceived of the idea of a unity that binds all human beings together.Read and prepare to be enlightened, inspired, irritated, and educated.Chapters include:- What manner of man is the prophet?- History- Chastisement- Justice- The Theology of Pathos- The Philosophy of Pathos- Anthropopathy- The Meaning and Mystery of Wrath- Religion of Sympathy- Prophecy and Ecstasy- Prophecy and Poetic Inspiration- Prophecy and Psychosis (there is a fine line between prophecy and madness, after all!)`This, then, is the ultimate category of prophetic theology: involvement, attentiveness, concern. Prophetic religion may be defined, not as what man does with his ultimate concern, but rather what man does with God's concern.'",1

But it would be unfair to dismiss the usefulness of the Alexander Technique if you don't succeed. After all, most people have lessons in learning how to drive a car and so it's not surprising if you end up needing at least some lessons in learning how to &quot;drive&quot; yourself in a better way.Ultimately, I think the best place to get a deeper understanding of the Technique is from Alexander's own books.

It is a long, slow and sometimes punishing read. Laxness paints the sheep farmer's life in bleak tones. Think of Solzhenitsyn's Siberia or Rolvaag's Dakota prairie. So dismal is the mood at times that the reader feels the imminent onset of seasonal affective disorder. But Independent People also contains moments of pure, distilled beauty so arresting they seem to stand out from the cold landscape like stars in the ink of darkness. Bjartur of Summerhouses is a true epic hero. As Monte Christo is to vengeance, Bjartur is to self-determination. His emotional intransigence and the suffering he visits on all those close to him is balanced only by the enormity and brute force of his will. Asta Sollilja, his daughter, is the only possible counterweight to his obstinacy, in both emotional and literary terms. She is strong and sensitive, beautiful and grotesque, half Bjartur, half anti-Bjartur. Her duality provides the story's central drama and the book's over-arching metaphor. Masterfully constructed of vignettes woven into small books, Independent People is seamless. Laxness's voice is clear and lyric, never showy. The writing is fresh and modern, yet seems to be channeled from Iceland's mythic past. This is a land populated by many dark spirits and one never feels quite free of their presence here. Certain images from Independent People are indelibly etched on my consciousness. A man violently and accidentally riding a reindeer. A girl longing by a window for a stranger she's met just once. A young man seduced back to the home he has left by a siren on horseback. There is something more to why I love this book. I spent a week in Iceland in July 1998, and was transfixed by its rugged, austere beauty. The feeling I had while reading Independent People was the same feeling that possessed me the entire time I was in Iceland. It was the cold, astonishing sensation of stepping outside your self and gazing on the topography of your own heart.",1

"A Writer at War: Vasily Grossman with the Red Army, 1941-1945","In the summer of 1941, as the Germans invade Russia, newspaper reporter Vasily Grossman is swept to the frontlines, witnessing some of the most savage atrocities in Russian history. As Grossman follows the Red Army from the defence of Moscow, to the carnage at Stalingrad, to the Nazi genocide in Treblinka, his writings paint a vividly raw and devastating account of Operation Barbarossa during World War Two. Grossman’s notebooks, war diaries, personal correspondence and newspaper articles are meticulously woven into a gripping narrative and provide a piercing look into the life of the author behind recent Sunday Times bestseller Stalingrad. A Writer at War stands as an unforgettable eyewitness account of the Eastern Front and places Grossman as the leading Soviet voice of ‘the ruthless truth of war’. ‘A remarkable addition to the literature of 1941 – 1945...a wonderful portrait of the wartime experience of Russia... A worthy memorial to a remarkable man’ Sunday Telegraph",['Vasily Grossman'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fj58ToHg2QcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=fj58ToHg2QcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=A+Writer+at+War:+Vasily+Grossman+with+the+Red+Army,+1941-1945&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Random House,2010-06-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fj58ToHg2QcC&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],7.0,0375424075,,A28PRU8FTMCT8J,"Leonard Fleisig ""Len""",94/96,5.0,1139270400,"""I kneel behind the soldier's trench","I walk mid shamble smear and stench, The dead I mourn."" John Finley.The Soviet journalist and author Vasily Grossman did more than kneel behind the soldier's trench. He lived with the Red Army from the catastrophic summer of 1941, through the defense of Moscow, the apocalyptic carnage of Stalingrad, the hard-won liberation of Soviet territory, the horrible discoveries of Nazi genocide in Madjanek and Treblinka, and the final bloody, triumphant march into Berlin. Anthony Beevor and Luba Vinogradova's ""A Writer at War: Vasily Grossman with the Red Army 1941-1945"" is a marvelous examination of both ""Grossman's war"" and the war itself.Vasily Grossman is something of a forgotten, unsung giant of Soviet literature. Born in Berdichev, Ukraine in 1905, Grossman rose to prominence and received national acclaim as a war reporter for Red Star, the official newspaper of the Red Army. Although never a member of the Communist Party, Grossman was, for most of his life, a strong supporter of the Soviet Union. Grossman's reporting was realistic (despite editing by Party censors) and was enormously popular among both high ranking officers and foot soldiers. After the war, Grossman returned to writing. His magnum opus, Life and Fate was not published in the USSR until 1988. When it was originally submitted for publication the Soviet authorities `arrested' the book and told Grossman that it would not be published for 200 years. Fortunately, a copy of the manuscript survived, was smuggled to Switzerland and published in Europe in 1980, fifteen years after Grossman's death. Life and Fate was based, in good part, on Grossman's wartime experiences. Consequently, Beevor's work provides both an historical, ground-level examination of the war generally and a great deal of insight into the life experiences that formed the moral foundation of Grossman's novels.Beevor (and his translator and collaborator Vinogradova) have taken Grossman's notebooks, war diaries, personal correspondence and his Red Star articles and set them out as part of their narrative. The transition from Grossman's text to the commentary is well thought out and seamless. Beevor is no stranger to the Eastern Front, (he has written two well received books""Stalingrad"" and ""The Fall of Berlin"") and he does an excellent job of putting Grossman's writings into the context of his times.Grossman is swept into the war as a reporter for Red Star immediately after the German invasion in June, 1941. Grossman's writing (and Beevor's commentary) takes us through that first disastrous summer of defeat, despair, death, and retreat. The magnificent and bloody defense of Stalingrad follows and the success of Operation Uranus in November, 1942 that resulted in the encirclement and destruction of General Paulus' Sixth Army follows. The next portion of the book has Grossman writing about the Red Army on the offensive, from the Battle of Kursk through the liberation of the Ukraine and then Poland. It is here that Grossman first learns of the horror that was the holocaust.Grossman's reports from Treblinka were the first, first-hand accounts of the Nazi death camps and what Grossman saw changed his life. Although Jewish, Grossman had always considered himself a secular citizen of the USSR. The death camps and the murder of his mother at the hands of Nazis and Ukrainian collaborators reawakened his sense of a Jewish identity even though he remained totally secular. Grossman's experience of the camps and the evidence he saw there of man's innate inhumanity to man stunned him even after almost 4 years of living with brutality on an unfathomable scale. In ending one of his reports Grossman writes: ""It is infinitely hard even to read this. The reader must believe me, it is as hard to write it. Someone might ask: ""Why write about all this, why remember all that?"" It is the writer's duty to tell this terrible truth, and it is the civilian duty of the reader to learn it.""It is clear from reading A Writer at War and two of Grossman's novels, ""Life and Fate"" and ""Forever Flowing"" that Grossman took his duty to tell his terrible truth seriously.

D. Brault,94/96,4.0,1285804800,Great Book - Found Replacement Stickers!,"I don't remember this book as a kid, but my mom swears I had it. Now I'm 33 and I have a daughter of my own and this was given to us Christmas of 2008. It was during Christmas 2009 when she really found this book and fell in love with it, as did I reading it to her. We just love it. As other reviewers have said, this book just evokes great memories of the Christmas season. And who can not love the scratch and sniff smells.Now here is lies the rub about this book. Only the very potent aromatic smells last at all. Pine and peppermint were still going a year later, but the rest (apple pie, gingerbread, hot chocolate, and orange) were pretty much dead. And after just one season even the pine and peppermint started to go. So what is one to do when your one of your daughter's favorite books loses its prominent scratch and sniff feature. Well you go on a sticker hunt and as of Sept 2010, I've now found them all.Since it was so hard to find these stickers I wanted to post a review of the book and a location that other parents like me could find replacement stickers. I started my search in June 2010 and found almost all of them at the website EverythingSmells.com. The only scent that seemed non-existent was gingerbread (unless you wanted to buy 2500 stickers from a custom company or cut your own out of Target greeting cards). So I emailed the company and asked if they knew of anywhere to get gingerbread. They didn't know, but kept my email and just wrote me today to tell me that they now have a gingerbread sticker for sale! So now you can get all the stickers in one place! Mind you, they will not look like the original stickers, but at least the children don't care. It's the act of scratching and sniffing that matters to them.So to the parents out there that bemoan the fact that the book has lost its smell--go get some stickers (with plenty of spares), paste them in, and re-enjoy the book with your children or grandchildren for all it's Christmas charm. I know we did and still do today.",1

Drugs are potent, only work patchily and have nasty side effects.This useful little book looks at one probable underlying migraine cause -- magnesium deficiency. Dr Cohen describes how up to 75% of Americans are deficient in this mineral and as a consequence are sick in many ways. Doctors are widely ignorant about magnesium and, in the pharma-culture that predominates, think of drugs as first resort rather than last.Dr Cohen reviews many of the lifestyle factors that seem to provoke migraines, many of which deplete the body's magnesium stores.Prudently, he does not claim that correcting the magnesium deficiency will cure all migraine headaches. However, he provides impressive evidence (evidence that your doctor will respect) that a high percentage of patients will get relief.This eminently readable book has guidance on the types of magnesium available and how to find the right dose for you.Of course, from the anthropological point of view, humans were not designed to have migraines or take supplements. As a nutritional anthropologist and authorDeadly Harvest, I would prefer people to restructure their lives, notably eating habits, so that migraines disappear. Having said that, for those migraine sufferers who cannot manage the complete program, the insights in this book could transform their lives.",1

The other books that we liked were the &quot;Girlfriend's guides&quot; but this has a lot more detail, and I feel that it covers a lot more basics. My wife relies heavily on her mother, and a Russian version of Dr Spock, but we tend to leave the final decision to the American Academy.What I really like about this book is that the index is large, and easy to use. So if I look up &quot;rash&quot; there are cross-references to all the various sorts of rash that might appear. Someone has put in a lot of time to make sure that a panicked parent can go straight to this index, and find the key part of the text.The content is very much aimed at the &quot;average&quot; child. This is good in a way, as it does not worry you with rare ailments, and tells you to go see a doctor if there is anything out of the ordinary. So you get advice on dealing with the more common, middle of the road stuff by yourself, but if, God forbid, something more rare comes up, they send you to the doctor. Fair enough - no one wants a lawsuit for giving advice on a patient that they haven't seen, and every child is unique.The other thing that is surprising is that the milestones seem to be late - our daughter seems very early compared to the guidelines in this book, as do other children her age. So it may be that they consciously say that you should expect your child to do something later than they actually do, to avoid people panicking if their child develops some skill later in life. This looks like it would be unavoidable in a book that is trying to be applicable to a group that is as diverse as small children.Anyway, this book has been very helpful to me as the father of a young child, and I hope that your mileage is the same as mine.",1

That is, he rejected the notion that barbarian invasions in the 4th and 5th centuries caused the collapse of the Roman Empire.

Chardin's theology, banned for years by the Vatican, was at least a hundred years ahead of it's time. A geologist, palenthologist, mystic, spiritual lover, he proposed that Darwin's theories of evolution were not contrary to God's revelation but actually was Revelation.King's book does a good job of detailing Chardin's life, his passions, his pursuits, his beliefs and his science. Though dry and slow at times, the author does help to illuminate the theology of someone who isn't easy to read. Though he lived a rich life, Chardin's writing can be somewhat cold and too scientific at times for the layreader to understand.

Having tried both and finding them difficult to follow, Fife's book is the great median. First I followed Enig's book, but found it too restrictive. She places a lot of emphasis on fermented foods and while I eat some and understand why we need them, I wasn't able to eat them to the extent that she recommends. Grove's book, on the other hand, places a lot of emphasis on eating animal fats, specifically pork fat. In the beginning I enjoyed the bacon and tried to eat other types of pork but found it really difficult. The bacon was too salty and after a while I really didn't like eating that much pork. I almost felt sick of it (I have to say that I am Jewish and pork was never part of my eating habits, unless I eat Chinese food - then it was kosher!). I did lose weight with Groves, but it was hard to maintain.Bruce Fife's plan works very well. In fact I cannot conceive of eating any other way now. If I couldn't have the coconut oil and butter and other fats, I don't know what I'd eat. I feel better than I have in years. I used to have knee pain and that is gone. My skin is not dry (I've had skin problems for years that are clearing up now). My only problem is that it is easy to slip into a pattern of eating too much protein. That has prevented weight loss and in fact caused some slight weight gain. Keeping a food log is helpful to avoid that pitfall. But when I make sure I get enough fat I definitely eat less. I am amazed, sometimes at how much less. Weight loss is slow but steady. This is the secret the diet industry doesn't want you to know!One last note: my holistic doctor is so impressed with this program that he has been following it himself, has seen the benefits and is beginning to apply it in his practice. He is really excited about this truly different way of eating.",1

Many people dislike it or don't like it as much when compared to Pride and Prejudice or Emma, but there are many reasons why Persuasion should not be compared to Austen's other novels. This novel was the last one that Austen wrote before she died. It is a more mature novel, dealing with many issues not found in Austen's previous novels. One reason why people find faults with the book is that Anne Elliot, the heroine, is not as spunky or witty as an Elizabeth Bennett or an Emma Woodhouse. There is not so much wit flowing in the dialogue between characters, or even dialogue in general. But these differences between the novels make this one so unique.It is a novel of second chances. Anne Elliot, no longer in the bloom of youth, is a grown woman of 27 or 28 years. Eight years ago she had been happily in love with a handsome man named Frederick Wentworth. But, unfortunately, due to his financial status, and Anne under the influence of her family and close friend, was forced to reject his marriage proposal and they parted ways. But now, he is within her closest circle once again. Circumstances led to Anne staying with her married sister, Mrs. Muskgrove, while her own house was being let to Wentworth's sister and husband. Wentworth visits his sister and on calling on the Muskgroves finds Anne among them. Anne finds Wentworth, not only looking as good as he ever did, but is now Captain Wentworth, who has made his fortune. Wentworth, still angry with Anne over being rejected, causes him to treat Anne very cooly. But over many weeks of contact here and there, you catch on that Captain Wentworth isn't all that oblivious to Anne anymore, because of all the little 'glimpses' he throws at Anne. The tension between the two is amazing. You can sense a connection between the two, even though they are on opposite ends of the room. In Bath, the tension builds and builds until it culminates into one of the most moving and romantic reunions ever. The letter that Wentworth writes to Anne declaring his love is bound to bring a tear to your eye and a pang in your heart. Happily, all ends well, but throughout the novel you can easily sympathize with Anne. No longer youthful and no longer as pretty as she used to be, she is full of self-consciousness and confusion. She still loves him after all those years, but she cannot act upon her desires.Austen, yet again, excels in portraying her characters. Anne and Captain Wentworth are full and delightful characters that one must love. Her descriptions of Anne's vain father and snobbish older sister, Elizabeth, hit the mark on satirizing the members of society during that time. She wittingly describes how everyone tolerates Mrs. Muskgrove's hypochondriatic self and how everyone deals with her in their own way. There is not so much dialogue between characters in this book, compared to Austen's other novels. Most of the book is in observation of Anne's character and feelings, which makes it so much easier to relate to everything that Anne feels and you understand her situation all the more. This is a wonderful novel, with many qualities, differing from those of Austen's previous novels, to enjoy and admire.",1
Mohammed and Charlemagne,"2017 Reprint of 1939 Edition. Full facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition software. Henri Pirenne's classic history of Europe between the fifth and ninth centuries, Mohammed and Charlemagne, although published on the eve of the Second World War, remains an important work to this day. His famous summary said, ""Without Islam, the Frankish Empire would have probably never existed, and Charlemagne, without Muhammad, would be inconceivable.""

Python in a Nutshell,"This book offers Python programmers one place to look when they needhelp remembering or deciphering the syntax of this open source languageand its many powerful but scantily documented modules. Thiscomprehensive reference guide makes it easy to look up the mostfrequently needed information--not just about the Python languageitself, but also the most frequently used parts of the standard libraryand the most important third-party extensions. Ask any Python aficionado and you'll hear that Python programmers haveit all: an elegant object-oriented language with readable andmaintainable syntax, that allows for easy integration with componentsin C, C++, Java, or C#, and an enormous collection of precoded standardlibrary and third-party extension modules. Moreover, Python is easy tolearn, yet powerful enough to take on the most ambitious programmingchallenges. But what Python programmers used to lack is a concise andclear reference resource, with the appropriate measure of guidance inhow best to use Python's great power. Python in aNutshell fills this need. Python in a Nutshell, Second Edition covers morethan the language itself; it also deals with the mostfrequently used parts of the standard library, and the most popular andimportant third party extensions. Revised and expanded forPython 2.5, this book now contains the gory details of Python's newsubprocess module and breaking news about Microsoft's newIronPython project. Our ""Nutshell"" format fits Python perfectly bypresenting the highlights of the most important modules and functionsin its standard library, which cover over 90% of your practicalprogramming needs. This book includes: A fast-paced tutorial on the syntax of the Python language An explanation of object-oriented programming in Python Coverage of iterators, generators, exceptions, modules,packages, strings, and regular expressions A quick reference for Python's built-in types and functionsand key modules Reference material on important third-party extensions,such as Numeric and Tkinter Information about extending and embedding Python Python in a Nutshell provides a solid,no-nonsense quick reference to information that programmers rely on themost.

The explanations sometimes include some dense code:* There is a long example of using meta-classes.* The explanation of the new try/except/finally assumes that you understand the old (broken) behavior.* The 'with' statement is explained by way of an equivalent fragment of code.These changes make the 2nd edition ideal for the practicing Python programmer.

Michener has conceived and written an epic novel about the land we now know as Alaska. Using his characteristic writing style of starting at the very beginning (in this case, with native people living on the coastland we now know of as Eastern Russia) and then developing the story generation after generation through his rich and interesting characters, Michener tells the complete story of Alaska. The reader learns how Alaska was first settled, what animals first roamed its lands, what the native Inuit people were like in their unique culture and how they survived in the harsh environment, how the Americans bought the land from Russia, how the gold rush happened and what it was like for gold prospectors in the unforgiving winderness, and finally, it tells the story of the multi-ethnic peoples of Alaska, and this perhaps is Michener's strength in story-telling. Michener, as he has done in other novels, again proves his writing has a prophetic nature to it, as the last chapter details an earthquake in the Pacific Ocean that sends a Tsunami wall of water to assault the shore or Alaska, eerily reminiscient of the tsunami that devastated Sri Lanka recently.Yes, the novel is long - over 1,000 pages, but it is still an absorbing page-turner. Each chapter is a mini-novel in itself and tells the story of a particular generation of people in Alaska's development. Michener has a knack of creating and developing characters that are both interesting and believable and this is his greatest strength as a writer. The reader comes to care about these fictious charcters as though they are living breathing realities, and in a sense, the charcters are ""real"", as Michener's painstaking research enabled him to form his charcters based on historical personages.""Alaska"" is a marvelous book, and for those that are into long sweeping novels, this is a book for you. It seems that Michener's writing style either fascinates or tries the patience of his readers. Michener goes into great detail in explaining the lives of his characters and some readers are impatient with his extensive prose and are apt to put his books down before finishing them. I happen to love his writing style and appreciate the detail, as it paints vivid word pictures in my mind. Michener is one of my favorite authors, for each of his books takes me to a particular place or culture, and it is as though I am actually viewing that culture, its people, and the land first-hand. I have learned a wealth of information about distant lands thanks to the writing of James A. Michener. These are places I may never visit in my life, but thanks to Michener, it is as though I have been there through his writing.I most certainly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about the land and people of Alaska, or to one who is contemplating a trip to Alaska (the bok makes compelling reading even if you have no intention of going to Alaska!). Once you read Michener's ""Alaska"", you will have a tremendous appreciation for the hardships that the settlers endured to ""tame"" this great land. I guarantee you will always remember ""Alaska"" for the rest of your life.I highly recommend this book!Jim ""Konedog"" Koenig",1

The Koran Interpreted: A Translation,"An English translation of the Muslim holy book portrays the spirit, rather than the exact context and rhythm, of the original Arabic text.",['A. J.

These kinds of things detract more from the reading than add to it. I am very dismayed by the awkwardness of many of the other translations available for us, including that of Yusuf Ali, whose popular work, while praised for it accuracy, leaves a lot to be desired in the realm of style, enjoyment and ease of understanding.Arberry's work, however, is simple, direct, formal and hits a mid-point between poetry and prose; in other words, tries as much as possible to present the Koran for English speakers the way the Koran would have functioned for listeners of Arabic.To enhance the clarity of the translation, Arberry distinguishes between the second person plural and second person singular by making use of the word 'thou' and its accompanying grammar for the singular. This distinction is critical for determining when God is speaking about others and when He is speaking to the Prophet directly. This is surely the only sensible way to render the distinction, in a translation that wishes itself to be readable. Arberry does not use any other archaic words, such as 'ye' or archaic grammar such as 'he hath', but uses fully modern English throughout.It should be noted that people who are bilingual and have actually taken the time to read through Arberry's translation have found it to be very accurate.The fact that Arberry has no religious axe to grind makes the translation more reliable than the many sectarian translations put out more for the sake of publicizing particular beliefs than for the sake of producing accurate, well-written texts.The educational value of this book is far greater than that of the awkward translations, since it presents a style worthy of emulation rather than one unnatural or strange.Reading a good translation such as this one can help us not only gain wisdom, but also articulate this wisdom for others. The Koran is a work of divine rhetoric, and the more we can apply its lessons into our own lives and language, the more useful it will be for us.I encourage you to read this translation above all others, if English is your native tongue.",1

Michener has conceived and written an epic novel about the land we now know as Alaska. Using his characteristic writing style of starting at the very beginning (in this case, with native people living on the coastland we now know of as Eastern Russia) and then developing the story generation after generation through his rich and interesting characters, Michener tells the complete story of Alaska. The reader learns how Alaska was first settled, what animals first roamed its lands, what the native Inuit people were like in their unique culture and how they survived in the harsh environment, how the Americans bought the land from Russia, how the gold rush happened and what it was like for gold prospectors in the unforgiving winderness, and finally, it tells the story of the multi-ethnic peoples of Alaska, and this perhaps is Michener's strength in story-telling. Michener, as he has done in other novels, again proves his writing has a prophetic nature to it, as the last chapter details an earthquake in the Pacific Ocean that sends a Tsunami wall of water to assault the shore or Alaska, eerily reminiscient of the tsunami that devastated Sri Lanka recently.Yes, the novel is long - over 1,000 pages, but it is still an absorbing page-turner. Each chapter is a mini-novel in itself and tells the story of a particular generation of people in Alaska's development. Michener has a knack of creating and developing characters that are both interesting and believable and this is his greatest strength as a writer. The reader comes to care about these fictious charcters as though they are living breathing realities, and in a sense, the charcters are ""real"", as Michener's painstaking research enabled him to form his charcters based on historical personages.""Alaska"" is a marvelous book, and for those that are into long sweeping novels, this is a book for you. It seems that Michener's writing style either fascinates or tries the patience of his readers. Michener goes into great detail in explaining the lives of his characters and some readers are impatient with his extensive prose and are apt to put his books down before finishing them. I happen to love his writing style and appreciate the detail, as it paints vivid word pictures in my mind. Michener is one of my favorite authors, for each of his books takes me to a particular place or culture, and it is as though I am actually viewing that culture, its people, and the land first-hand. I have learned a wealth of information about distant lands thanks to the writing of James A. Michener. These are places I may never visit in my life, but thanks to Michener, it is as though I have been there through his writing.I most certainly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about the land and people of Alaska, or to one who is contemplating a trip to Alaska (the bok makes compelling reading even if you have no intention of going to Alaska!). Once you read Michener's ""Alaska"", you will have a tremendous appreciation for the hardships that the settlers endured to ""tame"" this great land. I guarantee you will always remember ""Alaska"" for the rest of your life.I highly recommend this book!Jim ""Konedog"" Koenig",1

Woolley ""Editor, DiabeticMommy.com""",94/95,5.0,1096416000,A new recommended must-have for diabetics,"I am the editor of Diabetic Mommy Online Magazine. I have lots of diabetes books in my personal library and there are a select few that I am always recommending to members on my site. This one is now at the top of my list of essential diabetes books for insulin users, both syringe and pump users.I found this book at my local library. I thought it had a catchy title and took it home. Cute title aside, this book took me by total surprise. It is now on my wish-list because it will make a tremendous difference in my self-management plus I want to mark this baby up with notes.If you have diabetes, you might be like me...you read in books and hear organizations stressing self-management however your own healthcare team won't give you enough information to make corrections on your own so you are still dependent on them for every single little adjustment. Busy schedules for all parties mean that a simple correction can be a hassle and a long wait.This book is not intended to be a replacement for your healtcare team, don't get me wrong, but it provides you with enough information so that you will not be totally helpless and you will have more knowledge to work WITH your team rather than just be the recipient of instructions.This book covers many topics: Why diabetics need to be in control of their glucose levels, history of diabetes, insulin basics, tips, various methods of insulin dosing, having diabetes in the ""real"" world, hypo/hyperglycemia, resources, forms, and easy formulas for personalizing your insulin doses and timing, etc. It is the most detailed and clear book on the subject I have seen yet.Something else this book has going for it is great clear writing and the unavoidable good-humor of the author. He really made me chuckle. If you are a pop-culture fan like me...and you recognize the phrase, ""Hi, I'm Larry, this is my brother Darryl and this is my other brother Darryl,"" Then you'll feel right at home with this book!I also found very interesting facts that I didn't know before - such as mind work lowers your glucose levels and that caffeine effects your glucose levels.The only slight problem I had was that the author seems to be a man who really loves sports - while I am a woman who really does not! Many of his analogies use sporting examples which most of the time leave me pretty clueless. In addition, he definitely communicates ""man-style."" He uses very visual-type examples and explanations.For example, I feel if the author were to give my husband and I driving directions, my husband would understand right away and take off. (He wouldn't necesarrily find the place - haha) I, on the other hand, would have to review the info, ask for landmarks, and make some notes. (I would find it for sure!)While the book gives detailed and complete information, I would have found a little summarizing in the form of a cheat sheet would have been fantastic. Worksheets to enter your information and make up your personal plan would be great too. He does have helpful log sheets in the book.As a result of reading this book, I feel more empowered regarding my ability to troubleshoot and correct. And it will open up a dialogue with my healthcare team and possibly start a battle with my insurance company. I found in my own personal case (and everyone is different), I would probably do best with a pump. In lieu of that, long-acting, short-acting AND an occasional intermediate acting insulin via syringes would be good too. I would feel confident enough to make the suggestions to my team, but I don't know how realistic it would be for them to provide me with all three different types of insulin. I woudn't hold my breath for a pump either!In spite of this, I still give the book 5 stars because I feel it is so valuable and there is more than enough information for me to make my own info sheets and make suggestions for my care.",1

It arms you with the knowledge necessary to maximize chances of conception (or lower the risks of pregnancy in those who do not wish to conceive) and does so in an enjoyable, easy-to-read manner that does not belittle or overwhelm its audience. The wealth of information in this book about a woman's cycle and how to chart it are absolutely fantastic, and one is left with a sense of 'how could I not have known all this was going on in my body before?' Although I highly recommend this book, I would also like to offer a much-needed word of warning about it: page after page after page of success stories are presented, leaving the general impression that the whole process of conception is MUCH easier than it is. The author repeatedly presents 'case studies' of women who conceived after only ONE MONTH of using the methods in this book. The overall effect is one of effortless and immediate conception if the guidelines provided by the author are followed religiously. Although I do not believe it is intentional, I have to say I feel the book is deceptive in this regard. It also promotes methods of determining pregnancy that absolutely are NOT definite and that, if taken to heart by the reader, can leave one devestated at the end of a cycle, when the feeling of 'but I don't understand, the book said I must be pregnant' take over. I have seen too many women experience these disappointments to consider any honest review of this book complete without mentioning these things. The reader should use a healthy dose of skepticism about some of her more controversial ideas and use the book mainly as a guide to getting to know one's body and learn how to determine ovulation. It truly is invaluable in that regard. But don't let all those case studies get you overexcited or build up unrealistic expectations. Conception still is not an exact science, no matter how much knowledge you have at your disposal, and you still may be in for a wait, no matter how faithfully you follow these guidelines.",0

Here is one of the prototypes (along with Robert Louis Stevenson's &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, written just a few years earlier) of the modern adventure-action story. There is lots to admire in this well crafted story: great action, excitement, characters, and exotic locations.

Also, for beginners, it's got some pretty good instructions and examples of drawing all parts of the body (head, eyes, mouth, arm, leg, feet, hands, etc).If you think you might be interested in this area of drawing, get this book! You can't beat the quality for the price. In my opinion, a rare gem!",1
Living Foods for Optimum Health : Staying Healthy in an Unhealthy World,"Explains why living foods are important to good health and offers a plan for making the switch to a living foods diet, with lifestyle suggestions and over one hundred recipes",['Brian R.

In Chapter 6, there is a six-month plan mapped out, with incremental changes, and says under &quot;Personalizing the Program&quot;: &quot;If you consistently make living foods at least 75 percent (by weight) of your daily intake, your dedication to achieving total body health will bring rewards that know no bounds&quot;.I'm at the 75 raw/25 cooked point myself, and at 58, I'm in better health than at any other time in my life.In Chapter 1, we read how we have exchanged, in the last century, a plant-based diet for a meat-based one, and how &quot;the results have proven to be disastrous for our health and the environment&quot;.The regeneration of cells is a fascinating topic (it takes 7 years to complete a full regeneration), and Mr. Clement states that &quot;It's not added years that cause the body to age into a diseased state. It's the cell starvation that results from years of ingesting processed and cooked foods&quot; (pg.42).The causes and cures for many diseases are discussed, as well as depression and alcoholism, and the &quot;Mind/Body Connection&quot;.There are numerous food lists, and show how to combine foods for the best nutritional results and ease of digestion.Under &quot;Shopping for Recreational Foods&quot;, some cooked food is listed, so one can have a little &quot;fun with food&quot; from time to time.There's a chapter on sprouts, and how to germinate them, and the value of doing so, as well as over 50 pages of recipes. Page 235 has this simple one:&quot;Avocado Cups1 ripe avocado, peeled and pitted4 apples, cored and chopped2 tablespoons lemon juice1/4 cup pure waterBlend all ingredients until smooth. Pour into glass custard cups and serve immediately.Makes 4 servings&quot;&quot;You'll come to see that the Hippocrates diet isn't a trial by sacrifice, but rather a challenge of change. It's time to look in new directions for the food your body needs&quot; (pg.114)If you want to maximize your health and increase your energy level, I highly recommend trying this raw food diet. If implemented gradually, there will be little in the way of withdrawal symptoms, and I'm amazed that I no longer crave either sugar or coffee...this coming from someone who has had an addiction to sugar since childhood.",1
